# Versioning

This guide defines UCP's release-branch and backport process. UCP uses date-based version identifiers in `YYYY-MM-DD` format; see [Component Versioning and Release Snapshots](/pr-test/latest/specification/overview/#component-versioning-and-release-snapshots) for the normative release model and [Protocol Version](/pr-test/latest/specification/overview/#protocol-version) for profile selection.

New development occurs on the `main` branch. We maintain long-lived branches for all supported releases of the spec so that a published snapshot `D` stays available for reference and maintenance. Backport eligibility and approval — approved backwards-compatible changes by default, breaking changes only through exceptional Governance Council approval — are defined in [Component Versioning and Release Snapshots](/pr-test/latest/specification/overview/#component-versioning-and-release-snapshots). A backported change lands on the maintained `release/D` branch, and UCP re-certifies the snapshot before publishing the updated artifacts.

- When the Tech Council approves a new version of UCP, we will cut a new branch named `release/YYYY-MM-DD` directly from the current state of `main`.
  - We will implement a code freeze on the release branch the moment a `release/YYYY-MM-DD` branch is cut. Only changes permitted by the backport policy should move during this window.
  - Approved backward-compatible changes discovered after cutting a release branch should be made in one of two ways:
  - The change is made on the release branch and merged to `main`.
  - The change is made on `main` and cherry-picked to the release branch.
- Once finalized, we will merge the release branch into `main` and tag it (e.g., `git tag -a vYYYY-MM-DD`). We will use a GitHub Action to detect the new tag and automatically generate a release notes draft and upload artifacts.
- Unlike temporary feature branches, `release/YYYY-MM-DD` branches are long-lived and correspond to specific versions of the spec for historical reference and maintenance.

## Breaking PRs

- Breaking changes should include `!` in the PR title
- Timing: We will announce the breaking change in Discussions 2 weeks before the change is merged.
- Security-sensitive fixes are the exception: the Governance Council sets the disclosure timeline case by case, so a fix is not announced before it is safe to disclose.
