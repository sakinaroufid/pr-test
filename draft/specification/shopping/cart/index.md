# Cart Capability

- **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.shopping.cart`

## Overview

The Cart capability enables basket building without the complexity of checkout. While [Checkout](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/shopping/checkout/index.md) manages payment handlers, status lifecycle, and order finalization, cart provides a lightweight CRUD interface for item collection before purchase intent is established.

**When to use Cart vs Checkout:**

- **Cart**: User is exploring, comparing, saving items for later. No payment configuration needed. Platform/agent can freely add, remove, update items.
- **Checkout**: User has expressed purchase intent. Payment handlers are configured, status lifecycle begins, session moves toward completion.

The typical flow: `cart session` → `checkout session` → `order`

Carts support:

- **Incremental building**: Add/remove items across sessions
- **Localized estimates**: Context-aware pricing without full checkout overhead
- **Sharing**: `continue_url` enables cart sharing and recovery

## Cart vs Checkout

| Aspect                 | Cart                       | Checkout                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**            | Pre-purchase exploration   | Purchase finalization                  |
| **Payment**            | None                       | Required (handlers, instruments)       |
| **Status**             | Binary (exists/not found)  | Lifecycle (`incomplete` → `completed`) |
| **Complete Operation** | No                         | Yes                                    |
| **Totals**             | Estimates (may be partial) | Final pricing                          |

## Cart-to-Checkout Conversion

When the cart capability is negotiated, platforms can convert a cart to checkout by providing `cart_id` in the Create Checkout request. The cart contents (`line_items`, `context`, `buyer`) initialize the checkout session.

```json
{
  "cart_id": "cart_abc123",
  "line_items": []
}
```

Business MUST use cart contents and MUST ignore overlapping fields in checkout payload. The `cart_id` parameter is only available when the cart capability is advertised in the business profile.

**Idempotent conversion:**

If an incomplete checkout already exists for the given `cart_id`, the business MUST return the existing checkout session rather than creating a new one. This ensures a single active checkout per cart and prevents conflicting sessions.

**Cart lifecycle after conversion:**

When checkout is initialized via `cart_id`, the cart and checkout sessions SHOULD be linked for the duration of the checkout.

- **During active checkout** — Business SHOULD maintain the cart and reflect relevant checkout modifications (quantity changes, item removals) back to the cart. This supports back-to-storefront flows when buyers transition between checkout and storefront.
- **After checkout completion** — Business MAY clear the cart based on TTL, completion of the checkout, or other business logic. Subsequent operations on a cleared cart ID return `not_found`; the platform can start a new session with `create_cart`.

## Quantity and sale basis

Cart line items apply the shared [quantities and units](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/overview/#quantities-and-units) contract. Each `line_items[].quantity` is an integer step count in the item's authoritative sale basis. On a Business response, an absent `line_items[].item.quantity_unit` encodes the default `each` basis, so `quantity` counts whole items.

On a Platform request, omission of `line_items[].item.quantity_unit` makes no assertion. The Business interprets `quantity` using the item's authoritative sale basis, so a request for a measure-denominated item can omit the descriptor without asserting `each`. The Platform **MAY** include `item.quantity_unit` to assert the sale-basis identity.

Cart follows [Checkout — Quantity and sale basis](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/shopping/checkout/#quantity-and-sale-basis) for sale-basis discovery, assertion matching, mismatch conversion or rejection, response echo, ordering-increment handling, and line pricing. Cart totals remain estimates (see [Total](#total)). A measure-denominated line counts as one line item in cart summaries; its `quantity` is an amount, not an item count.

## Actions

The cart surfaces outstanding Action instances in its response-only `actions` map, defined in [Overview — Actions](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/overview/#actions).

The cart has no status lifecycle. Each Action gates only the cart effect specified for its Action type. The Business **MUST NOT** treat an outstanding Action as a reason to reject an unrelated cart operation. The Platform **MAY** continue to add, remove, and update items while an Action is outstanding.

After processing an Action, the Platform **SHOULD** use [Get Cart](#get-cart) or a subsequent update response to obtain the latest Cart.

## Scopes

The Cart capability defines the following well-known scopes for user-authenticated access:

| Scope                          | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.cart:manage` | All cart operations on behalf of the authenticated user — create, read, update, persist. |

Scope declaration, derivation, and rules for extending this set with custom scopes are defined in [Identity Linking — Scopes](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/identity-linking/#scopes).

## Guidelines

### Platform

- **MAY** use carts for pre-purchase exploration and session persistence.
- **SHOULD** convert cart to checkout when user expresses purchase intent.
- **MAY** display `continue_url` for handoff to business UI.
- **SHOULD** handle `not_found` gracefully when cart expires or is canceled.

### Business

- **SHOULD** provide `continue_url` for cart handoff and session recovery.
- TODO: discuss `continue_url` destination - cart vs checkout.
- **SHOULD** provide estimated totals when calculable.
- **MAY** omit fulfillment totals until checkout when address is unknown.
- **SHOULD** return informational messages for validation warnings.
- **MAY** set cart expiry via `expires_at`.
- **SHOULD** follow [cart lifecycle requirements](#cart-to-checkout-conversion) when checkout is initialized via `cart_id`.

Creates a new cart session with line items and optional buyer/context information for localized pricing estimates.

When **all** requested items are unavailable, the business MAY return an error response instead of creating a cart resource. `ucp.status` is the primary discriminator; the absence of `id` is a consistent secondary indicator:

```json
{
  "ucp": { "version": "draft", "status": "error" },
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "out_of_stock",
      "content": "All requested items are currently out of stock",
      "severity": "unrecoverable"
    }
  ],
  "continue_url": "https://merchant.com/"
}
```

### Get Cart

Retrieves the latest state of a cart session. Returns `not_found` if the cart does not exist, has expired, or was canceled.

### Update Cart

Performs a full replacement of the cart session. The platform **MUST** send the entire cart resource. The provided resource replaces the existing cart state on the business side.

### Cancel Cart

Cancels a cart session. Business MUST return the cart state before deletion. Subsequent operations for this cart ID SHOULD return `not_found`.

## Entities

Cart reuses the same entity schemas as [Checkout](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/shopping/checkout/index.md). This ensures consistent data structures when converting a cart to a checkout session.

### UCP Response Cart

UCP metadata for cart responses. No payment handlers needed pre-checkout.

| price         | [Amount](/pr-test/draft/specification/reference/#amount)               | **Required** | Unit price in ISO 4217 minor units. Price is the amount per one whole `quantity_unit.unit` (for example, per lb or per hour); when `quantity_unit` is absent, it is per `each`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| quantity_unit | [Quantity Unit](/pr-test/draft/specification/reference/#quantity-unit) | Optional     | Sale basis this item's `quantity` is denominated in. On an authoritative Business response, absence encodes the default `each` machine identity (`C62`, 0); the Business MUST include this descriptor for every non-`each` response. On Platform requests, omission makes no assertion: the Business interprets `quantity` using the item's authoritative sale basis. If the Platform includes this descriptor, it asserts the unit-descriptor machine identity. The Business MUST compare that machine identity (`unit`, effective `scale`), ignore `display_text` and `increment`, and resolve a mismatch by conversion surfaced as a visible line revision with a warning, or by rejection with a recoverable business outcome; silent reinterpretation is forbidden. An explicit `C62` descriptor at effective scale 0 matches an authoritative basis represented by an absent descriptor. |
| unit_price    | [Unit Price](/pr-test/draft/specification/reference/#unit-price)       | Optional     | Pricing basis for this item. On an authoritative Business response, the Business MUST include `unit_price` on every line whose pricing basis differs from its sale basis (for example, priced per pound but sold per `each`); presence on a line marks the rate as transactional rather than display-only. When the pricing basis is the sale basis, `item.price` fully denominates the charge and this field MAY be omitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This provisional, non-binding hint is distinct from the Buyer's locality. The operation specification or an active capability/extension defines its effects. A common example in retail shopping is the default home store ID selected and saved by the user when purchasing groceries.                                                                                                      |

Informs relevance, recommendations, and personalization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Use IETF BCP 47 language tags (e.g., 'en', 'fr-CA', 'zh-Hans'). For REST, equivalent to Accept-Language header—platforms SHOULD fall back to Accept-Language when this field is absent; when provided, overrides Accept-Language. Businesses MAY return content in a different language if unavailable.                                                                                                                            |

Businesses determine presentment currency from context and authoritative signals; this hint MAY inform selection in multi-currency markets. Also serves as the denomination for price filter values — platforms SHOULD include this field when sending price filters. Response prices include explicit currency confirming the resolution.                                                                      |
| eligibility     | Array\[[Reverse Domain Name](/pr-test/draft/specification/reference/#reverse-domain-name)\] | Optional    | Buyer claims about eligible benefits such as loyalty membership, payment instrument perks, and similar. Recognized claims MAY inform the Business response (e.g., member-only product availability, adjusted pricing in catalog, provisional discounts at cart or checkout). Businesses MUST ignore unrecognized values without error. Values MUST use reverse-domain naming (e.g., 'com.example.loyalty_gold', 'org.school.student') and MUST be non-identifying. |
| payment         | Array[object]                                                                               | Optional    | Buyer-preferred payment handlers in priority order (most preferred first). Each entry names a handler advertised in the Business profile's `ucp.payment_handlers`, optionally narrowed to preferred instrument types. The Business SHOULD use it to preselect or prioritize the handler (and type, when given) and MAY ignore unavailable or ineligible entries; unrecognized values MUST be ignored without error.                                                |

### Signals

Environment data provided by the platform to support authorization and abuse prevention. Signal values MUST NOT be buyer-asserted claims. See [Signals](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/overview/#signals) for details and privacy requirements.

| Name               | Type   | Requirement | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| dev.ucp.buyer_ip   | string | Optional    | Client's IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).            |
| dev.ucp.user_agent | string | Optional    | Client's HTTP User-Agent header or equivalent. |

### Attribution

Platform-provided referral and conversion-event context — campaign IDs, click identifiers, and source/medium markers communicated by the platform. See [Attribution](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/overview/#attribution) for details and consent requirements.

Platform-emitted referral and conversion-event context — campaign identifiers, click IDs, source/medium markers, etc. The same parameters platforms communicate via URL query parameters in browser-based flows.

### Total

The same totals contract applies to cart and checkout. See [Checkout Totals](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/shopping/checkout/#totals) for the rendering contract, accounting identity, well-known types, repeating types, and sub-line semantics.

| amount       | [Signed Amount](/pr-test/draft/specification/reference/#signed-amount) | **Required** | Monetary amount in the currency's minor unit as defined by ISO 4217. Refer to the currency's exponent to determine minor-to-major ratio (e.g., 2 for USD, 0 for JPY, 3 for KWD). May be negative — the sign is intrinsic to the value (e.g., discounts are negative, charges are positive). |

Taxes MAY be included where calculable. Platforms SHOULD assume cart totals are estimates; accurate taxes are computed at checkout.

### Policy

Policies (return/refund terms, warranty, and the like) that apply to the items in this cart. JSONPath targets in `applies_to` are relative to this response root (e.g., `$.line_items[0]`). See [Policies](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/overview/#policies) for the full model.

| type        | [Reverse Domain Name](/pr-test/draft/specification/reference/#reverse-domain-name) | **Required** | Policy type discriminator. Open reverse-DNS vocabulary. Well-known values: `dev.ucp.shopping.policy.return` (return terms), `dev.ucp.shopping.policy.warranty` (warranty terms). Businesses MAY define custom types in their own domain (e.g., `com.example.policy.price_match`). Platforms MUST tolerate unknown values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| description | [Description](/pr-test/draft/specification/reference/#description)                 | **Required** | Human-readable policy summary in one or more formats (plain, markdown, html). Required on every policy so a platform can present it without understanding any type-specific fields. This is not the buyer-facing disclosure — display is compelled by a `messages[]` warning (see the Policies section).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Each target covers the node it names and everything nested under it, so a target on a product also covers its variants. A singular query (RFC 9535 Section 2.3.5.1; name and index selectors only) names a single node; filters, wildcards, and slices match a set. When omitted, the policy applies to the entire response. When policies of the same `type` contest a node, the narrowest target wins and overrides the rest. See the Policies section for how specificity resolves. |
