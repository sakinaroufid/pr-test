# Payment 3DS Challenge Action

This specification defines the 3DS challenge Action type declared by the [Payment Authentication extension](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment-authentication/index.md):

```text
dev.ucp.payment.three_ds_challenge
```

It asks the Platform to present a buyer-facing payment-authentication surface to complete 3DS challenges.

## Purpose and Scope

A 3DS challenge Action lets the Business and payment handler ask the Platform to present an issuer or provider challenge to the Buyer. UCP does not carry EMV 3DS payloads such as CReq/CRes, AReq/ARes, RReq/RRes, or `transStatus`. Those details remain within the loaded surface and the Business, payment handler, PSP, 3DS server, issuer, or ACS integration.

The Platform presents the surface and observes only when the Platform-facing interaction finishes or cannot continue. The Business determines the authentication and payment outcome from its server-side provider state.

## Blocking Action

The 3DS challenge Action gates the associated payment attempt from producing a completed Checkout while the occurrence remains outstanding. It does not assert that the Complete Checkout operation was rejected, and a terminal surface event does not itself lift the gate.

A Business **SHOULD** accept Complete Checkout, begin the payment attempt, and return `complete_in_progress` with the challenge Action. If the Business cannot accept completion before the challenge, it follows the core Checkout rule: it returns `incomplete` with a recoverable error Message whose `path` selects the challenge occurrence.

## Runtime Shape

The Action is emitted under its type key:

```json
{
  "actions": {
    "dev.ucp.payment.three_ds_challenge": [
      {
        "id": "three-ds-challenge-1",
        "config": {
          "payment_instrument_id": "instrument_1",
          "url": "https://payments.example.com/ucp/payment/3ds/session_456"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The config shape is defined inline by the [Payment Authentication extension schema](/pr-test/draft/schemas/shopping/payment_authentication.json).

| Field                   | Type   | Required | Notes                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payment_instrument_id` | string | ✓        | ID of the associated instrument in the containing Checkout. |
| `url`                   | string | ✓        | Absolute HTTPS URL for the buyer-facing challenge surface.  |

`config.url` **SHOULD** be Business- or provider-operated and own any provider-specific POST, such as submitting CReq to an ACS challenge URL. The Platform performs an ordinary navigation to it; it **MUST NOT** construct provider requests, parse challenge payloads, or relay 3DS protocol data.

## Platform Behavior

The Platform **MUST**:

1. validate the URL according to the Payment Authentication contract, the payment handler and instrument context, and Platform policy;
1. load the URL in an isolated, visible browser-capable surface;
1. complete the `action.ready` handshake before presenting the challenge;
1. prevent interaction with the rest of Checkout while the challenge is outstanding;
1. correlate embedded notifications with both this Action occurrence and the mounted surface; and
1. close the surface after `action.done`, `action.error`, unrecoverable load failure, or abandonment.

Mounting the surface **MUST** follow the shared [Payment Authentication rendering contract](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment-authentication/#surface-rendering-and-notifications) and [Embedded Protocol security requirements](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/embedded-protocol/#security).

On the web the surface may be a full-page frame, modal frame, or separate window when the negotiated handler defines that presentation and its security policy. A native Platform may use an isolated webview, browser view, or system browser. A top-level or system-browser handoff is permitted only when the handler defines a completion channel that the Platform can authenticate and correlate with the Action occurrence.

The Platform **MUST NOT** infer an authentication outcome from frame content, URL changes, or notification diagnostics.

## Embedded Notifications

After completing the shared [`action.ready` handshake](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment-authentication/#ready-handshake), the surface sends JSON-RPC 2.0 notifications defined by the [payment Action embedded contract](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment-authentication/#surface-rendering-and-notifications).

### Done

When the Platform-facing challenge interaction finishes, the surface **MUST** send:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "action.done",
  "params": {
    "id": "three-ds-challenge-1"
  }
}
```

`action.done` means only that the Platform should close the challenge surface and retrieve Checkout. It does not mean authentication or payment succeeded. After closing the surface, the Platform should issue Get Checkout to confirm processing state. Get Checkout is a read-only observation and does not itself advance the payment attempt; the Business advances Checkout state from server-side provider state (typically an out-of-band provider push/callback), independent of when the Platform calls Get Checkout.

A handler-owned surface **MAY** include provider-specific or diagnostic params such as correlation identifiers or SDK outcomes. Platforms **MUST** ignore unknown params for UCP processing unless the negotiated handler defines them. They are never authoritative payment outcomes by default.

### Error

If the surface cannot continue, it **MAY** send:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "action.error",
  "params": {
    "id": "three-ds-challenge-1",
    "error": {
      "ucp": { "version": "draft", "status": "error" },
      "messages": [
        {
          "type": "error",
          "code": "action_failed",
          "content": "The challenge surface could not continue.",
          "severity": "recoverable"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Surface-level codes are the shared [well-known `action.error` codes](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment-authentication/#surface-rendering-and-notifications). Buyer abandonment and provider authentication outcomes may be unavailable to the surface or known only by the provider backend; the Business and payment provider remain authoritative for those distinctions. After either notification, the Platform follows the shared Payment Authentication reconciliation contract.

## Combined Provider Flows

A payment provider may serve both device data collection and a challenge from one `config.url`. The emitted Action type describes the Platform-facing behavior:

- If the surface remains invisible and never requests Buyer interaction, the Business emits device data collection.
- If the surface may display a Buyer challenge, the Business emits 3DS challenge.

The Business must not emit an invisible DDC Action and then make that surface visible. If collection completes first, the preferred flow is to remove the DDC occurrence and emit a new challenge occurrence in a later Checkout response. The two occurrences have different Action types and IDs even when their `config.url` origin is the same.

## Deadline and Fallback

[EMV 3-D Secure Protocol and Core Functions v2.3.1.1](https://www.emvco.com/specifications/emv-3-d-secure-protocol-and-core-functions-specification-6/) gives the ACS 10 minutes (600 seconds) after successfully sending each challenge interface to the challenge iframe (Req 226). The surface and provider own that per-interface timer. It does not define a single UCP deadline beginning at the initial navigation.

The Platform applies a bounded outer-surface deadline defined by the handler or Platform policy, measured from navigation and capped by Checkout `expires_at`. The Business **MUST** choose an expiry that accommodates the handler-defined window. The outer deadline governs only the Platform-owned container and does not replace or reset an ACS timer.

The Platform may close sooner after a valid terminal notification, load failure, Buyer dismissal, or terminal Checkout state. When the outer deadline elapses, it **MUST** close the surface, treat the interaction as abandoned, and follow the non-successful surface reconciliation path. It **MUST NOT** remount the same Action type and `id`; further handling follows the parent Checkout Actions fallback, handoff, and cancellation rules.

## Security

The common [Payment Authentication security requirements](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment-authentication/#security-and-data-handling) apply. In addition:

- The handler's trust policy **MUST** authorize the initial and redirect origins before the Platform displays them.
- The Platform validates both message source and origin.
- A later Checkout response based on server-side provider state remains authoritative regardless of any surface notification.
