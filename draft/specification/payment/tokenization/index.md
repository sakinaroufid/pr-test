# Tokenization Guide

**OpenAPI:** [Tokenization API](/pr-test/draft/handlers/tokenization/openapi.json)

## Overview

This guide is for **implementers building tokenization payment handlers**. It defines the shared API, security requirements, and conformance criteria that all tokenization handlers follow.

**Note:** While the examples in this guide use card credentials, tokenization patterns apply to **any sensitive credential type**—bank accounts, digital wallets, loyalty accounts, etc. Compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS for cards) vary by credential type.

We offer a range of examples to utilize forms of tokenization in UCP:

| Example                                                                                                                                                   | Use Case                                            |

| [Processor Tokenizer](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment/examples/processor-tokenizer-payment-handler/index.md)           | Business or PSP runs tokenization and processing    |
| [Platform Tokenizer](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment/examples/platform-tokenizer-payment-handler/index.md)             | Platform tokenizes credentials for businesses/PSPs  |
| [Encrypted Credential Handler](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment/examples/encrypted-credential-payment-handler/index.md) | Platform encrypts credentials instead of tokenizing |

## Core Concepts

### Credential Flow

Tokenization handlers transform credentials between source and checkout forms:

|                     Tokenization Payment Flow                           |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                         |
|   Platform has:            Tokenizer            Business receives:      |
|   Source Credential    -->  /tokenize  -->         TokenCredential      |
|                                                                         |
|   +-----------------+                      +-------------------------+  |
|   | source_         |                      | checkout_               |  |
|   | credentials     |    What goes IN      | credentials             |  |
|   |                 |<---------------      |                         |  |
|   | * pan           |                      | What comes OUT          |  |
|   | * network_token |                ----->| * token                 |  |
|   |                 |                      |                         |  |
|   +-----------------+                      +-------------------------+  |
|                                                                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Tokenization handlers accept source credentials (e.g., a PAN credential) and produce checkout credentials (e.g., tokens).

A network token does not always need this round-trip. A handler **MAY** accept `network_token_credential.json` as a source credential for tokenization, or **MAY** accept it directly as a checkout credential, since the token is unusable without a matching cryptogram. The handler's specification **MUST** state which of the two it accepts.

### Token Lifecycle

Tokens move through distinct phases. Your handler specification must document which lifecycle policy you use:

```text
+--------------+    +--------------+    +--------------+    +--------------+
|  Generation  |--->|   Storage    |--->| Detokenize   |--->| Invalidation |
|              |    |              |    |              |    |              |
|Platform calls|    | Tokenizer    |    | Business/PSP |    | Token expires|
| /tokenize    |    | holds token  |    | calls        |    | or is used   |
|              |    | -> credential|    | /detokenize  |    |              |
+--------------+    +--------------+    +--------------+    +--------------+
```

| Policy             | Description                                 | Use Case                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-use**     | Invalidated after first detokenization      | Most secure; recommended default                |
| **TTL-based**      | Expires after fixed duration (e.g., 15 min) | Allows retries on transient failures            |
| **Session-scoped** | Valid for checkout session duration         | Complex flows with multiple processing attempts |

### Binding

All tokenization requests require a `binding` object that ties the token to a specific capability resource:

| Field  | Required | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type` | Yes      | The capability that owns the bound resource, for example `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout`                        |
| `id`   | Yes      | Opaque identifier of the bound resource within that capability. The caller **MUST** send a non-empty string |

See [Binding Schema](/pr-test/draft/schemas/common/types/binding.json).

Resource scope and participant scope are separate. Requests carry `identity` alongside `binding` rather than inside it: `binding` says which resource the token is for, `identity` says which participant it is for. `identity` is required when the caller acts on behalf of another participant, and omitted when the authenticated caller is that participant. See [Payment Identity Schema](/pr-test/draft/schemas/common/types/payment_identity.json).

Binding is a replay guard, not a resource reference. The following rules apply to every tokenizer:

1. A Tokenizer **MUST** verify a binding by exact equality over `type` and `id`. A Tokenizer **MUST NOT** accept a partial match, and **MUST NOT** reject a request because `binding` carries members it does not recognize. A Tokenizer **MUST** ignore unrecognized members when comparing. An extension that defines additional `binding` members **MUST** specify whether those members participate in the comparison; a Tokenizer implementing that extension **MUST** follow the extension's definition.
1. A Tokenizer **MUST** treat `binding.id` as opaque: it **MUST NOT** require the value to be resolvable, and **MUST NOT** reject a request because it cannot confirm that the identified resource exists.
1. A Tokenizer **MUST NOT** reject a request solely because it does not recognize `binding.type`. A tokenizer serving one capability today therefore remains usable by capabilities defined later without changing its implementation.
1. Every token is issued to exactly one participant. A Tokenizer **MUST** record that participant at `/tokenize` — from `identity` when present, otherwise the authenticated caller. On `/detokenize` a Tokenizer **MUST** resolve the requesting participant the same way, **MUST** verify it matches the participant recorded at issuance, and **MUST** verify that the authenticated caller is that participant or is authorized to act for it. A Tokenizer **MUST NOT** return the credential when either check fails. `identity` is a participant identifier, not a credential, and a Tokenizer **MUST NOT** accept it as authentication. The mechanism by which one participant is authorized to act for another is handler-defined and outside the scope of this specification.

## OpenAPI

Tokenization handlers implement two endpoints. Your handler **MAY** implement one or both depending on your architecture. Or none, like our encrypted payload example, which defines its own mechanism to encrypt.

### POST /tokenize

Converts a raw credential into a token bound to a capability resource and issued to a participant.

**When to implement:** Always, unless you are an agent generating tokens internally.

```json
POST /tokenize
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "credential": {
    "type": "pan",
    "number": "4111111111111111",
    "expiry_month": 12,
    "expiry_year": 2026,
    "cvc": "123"
  },
  "binding": {
    "type": "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout",
    "id": "abc123"
  },
  "identity": {
    "access_token": "merchant_001"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "token": "tok_abc123xyz789"
}
```

### POST /detokenize

Returns the original credential for a valid token. Binding must match.

**When to implement:** Always, unless you combine detokenization with processing (see PSP example).

```json
POST /detokenize
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {caller_access_token}

{
  "token": "tok_abc123xyz789",
  "binding": {
    "type": "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout",
    "id": "abc123"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "type": "pan",
  "number": "4111111111111111",
  "expiry_month": 12,
  "expiry_year": 2026,
  "cvc": "123"
}
```

**Note:** `identity` is omitted when the authenticated caller is the participant the token was issued to. Include it when acting on behalf of another participant (e.g., PSP detokenizing for business).

See the full [OpenAPI specification](/pr-test/draft/handlers/tokenization/openapi.json) for complete request/response schemas.

## Security Requirements

| Requirement                  | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Binding required**         | Credentials **MUST** be bound to a `binding` resource (`type` and `id`) and issued to exactly one participant to prevent reuse |
| **Binding verified**         | Tokenizer **MUST** verify binding matches before returning credentials                                                         |
| **Cryptographically random** | Use secure random generators; tokens must be unguessable                                                                       |
| **Sufficient length**        | Minimum 128 bits of entropy                                                                                                    |
| **Non-reversible**           | Cannot derive the credential from the token                                                                                    |
| **Scoped**                   | Token should only work with your tokenizer                                                                                     |
| **Time-limited**             | Enforce TTL appropriate to use case (typically 5-30 minutes)                                                                   |
| **Single-use preferred**     | Invalidate after first detokenization when possible                                                                            |

## Handler Specification Requirements

When publishing your handler, your specification document **MUST** include:

| Requirement                     | Example                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unique handler name**         | `com.example.tokenization_payment` (reverse-DNS format)           |
| **Endpoint URLs**               | Production and sandbox base URLs                                  |
| **Authentication requirements** | OAuth 2.0, API keys, etc.                                         |
| **Onboarding process**          | How participants register and receive identities                  |
| **Accepted credentials**        | Which credential types are accepted for tokenization              |
| **Token lifecycle policy**      | Single-use, TTL, or session-scoped                                |
| **Security acknowledgements**   | Participants receiving raw credentials must accept responsibility |

### Example Specification Outline

```markdown
**Handler Name:** `com.acme.tokenization_payment`
**OpenAPI:** [Tokenization API](site:handlers/tokenization/openapi.json)

| Environment | Base URL                           |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Production  | `https://api.acme.com/ucp`         |
| Sandbox     | `https://sandbox.api.acme.com/ucp` |

**Supported Instruments:**

| Instrument | Source Credentials           | Checkout Credentials |
| :--------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------- |
| `card`     | `pan`, `network_token`       | `token`              |

**Token Lifecycle:** Single-use (invalidated after detokenization)

**Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 client credentials

**Onboarding:** Register at portal.acme.com. Businesses receive `access_token` for handler identity.
```

## Conformance Checklist

A tokenizer handler conforms to this pattern if it:

- Publishes a handler specification at a stable URL with a unique, reverse-DNS `handler_name`
- Implements `/tokenize` and/or `/detokenize` per the OpenAPI
- Defines authentication and onboarding requirements
- Documents credential transformation between source and checkout forms
- Produces tokens compatible with the `TokenCredential` schema
- Specifies token lifecycle policy (TTL, single-use, etc.)
- Requires `binding` with `type` and `id` on tokenization requests
- Uses `PaymentIdentity` for participant identification
- Verifies `binding` matches by exact equality on detokenization requests
- Records the participant each token is issued to, and on detokenization verifies both that participant and the caller's authority to act for it
- Accepts binding types it does not recognize
- Requires security acknowledgements from participants receiving raw credentials
