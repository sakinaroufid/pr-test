# Payment Terms Extension

- **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.common.payment.terms`

## Overview

The Payment Terms extension lets a Business offer the Buyer a choice of **when** payment for a checkout is due. A lodging Business can offer one term that charges the full stay at booking and another that charges the first night now and the balance at check-in. A Business selling equipment can offer Net-30 alongside pay-now.

A **payment term** is an addressable, renderable choice composed of one or more **payment schedules**. Each schedule is one payment: an amount, and a complete buyer-facing statement of when it is due.

This extension adds two properties to `checkout.payment`:

- `terms[]` — the payment terms the Business offers for this checkout. Response-only.
- `selected_term_id` — the selected term. Present in a response whenever `terms` is; a Platform writes it to change the selection.

A Buyer picks one of the options in `terms[]`, the same way they pick one [fulfillment option](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/shopping/extensions/fulfillment/#platform-responsibilities).

## When a Checkout carries terms

Payment terms are optional. A Business offers them when a Checkout has something to say about payment timing — a choice between terms, or a single term whose schedules must be disclosed. Where payment is due in full at completion, a Business may omit `terms` and `selected_term_id` entirely, and the Checkout `total` is the amount due, as core Checkout already states.

Where `terms` is present it **MUST** contain at least one term, and `selected_term_id` **MUST** name one of them. The Checkout `total` is the selected term's total, so a list of terms without a selection would show an amount matching no stated term.

## Presenting payment terms

Presentation is **term-agnostic**: a Platform does not need to model deposits, installments, or trade credit to present a term meaningfully.

Given the Checkout's `currency`, a Platform that recognizes no `type` value and reads no payment-term field other than `title`, `description`, `schedules[].description`, and `schedules[].amount` **MUST** be able to present what is owed and when, for every term. A Business **MUST** author terms so this holds.

That floor covers amounts and timing. It does not by itself discharge a jurisdictional disclosure duty — a finance charge that must be given a prescribed prominence, for instance. Those obligations travel through [Disclosures](#disclosures), and a Platform that cannot honor them escalates rather than renders.

Everything above that floor is supplementary. `type` and `due_at` let a Platform that wants to do more — split the checkout into due-now and due-later, sort schedules, drive a calendar reminder — without ever being required to.

A Business offering exactly one term is disclosing rather than asking. A Platform **SHOULD** present that term without implying a choice.

## Payment schedules

A schedule is **one payment**. A term that charges four times has four schedules.

A Business **MUST** make each schedule's `description` a complete buyer-facing statement of when and how that payment is due, so that a Platform can render it verbatim. A Platform **MAY** use `type` and `due_at` for a richer presentation — a calendar view, a countdown, a reminder — but **MUST NOT** present derived timing that contradicts the `description`.

### Timing class

`type` is an open string vocabulary with exactly one well-known value:

| Type        | Meaning                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `immediate` | The payment is due when the checkout is completed. |

Any other value means the payment is **not** due at completion; the `description` states when it is due. A Platform **MUST** treat an unrecognized `type` as not due at completion. Businesses **MAY** use additional values such as `deferred` or `on_shipment`, but those values carry no protocol meaning beyond "not `immediate`".

### Due dates

`due_at` is an absolute RFC 3339 date-time. A Business **SHOULD** provide it when it can determine the due date at checkout, and **MUST** omit it when the date depends on a future event — "due on delivery" has no date yet. `due_at` never replaces `description`; it restates in machine-readable form what the description already says.

### Amounts

Each schedule states a single `amount`: the amount charged when that payment is taken, inclusive of tax and every other charge, in the Checkout `currency`.

A term's schedule amounts sum to the amount payable under that term. For the **selected** term, the Business **MUST** ensure that sum equals the checkout `total`.

Unselected terms are **indicative**. A term that discounts the purchase for paying today has a different payable amount than one that defers part of it, so only the selected term must match the checkout total at any moment.

Where the selected term changes what the purchase costs — a discount for paying today, a finance charge for paying over time — that difference **MUST** appear as its own entry in `checkout.totals`, a negative `discount` or a positive `fee`. A Business **SHOULD** set `display_text` on that entry so the Buyer can understand what choosing the term contributed.

## Selecting a payment term

Selecting a payment term is a **Checkout update**. A Platform sets `selected_term_id`; the Business returns a recomputed Checkout. That response is **authoritative for all derived state** — including `totals`, line item prices, discount eligibility, `policies[]`, `messages[]`, and the payment handlers offered.

A Platform **MUST NOT** assume that the amounts shown in `terms[]` survive selection unchanged, and **MUST** re-render from the response.

A Business **MUST** make `terms[].id` unique within a Checkout, so that a selection resolves to exactly one term.

In every response that carries `terms`, one of them is selected. Where the Buyer has made no choice, the Business selects a default.

A Platform changes the selection through Update Checkout, setting `selected_term_id` to an `id` from the latest `terms[]`. A Platform **MUST** omit it on create, because term IDs are scoped to a Checkout and no options exist yet — the create response establishes the options, if any, and the default among them. A Platform **MUST** omit it on complete, because the term is already agreed before a Checkout can reach `ready_for_complete`, and the amount due at completion follows from it. A Business receiving a selection that no longer resolves — because the options changed — **MUST NOT** silently substitute a term, and **MUST** report the change as a `payment_term_changed` warning in `messages[]`.

Selecting a term can invalidate a selection previously accepted elsewhere in the Checkout — a deferred term may not be available with a same-day fulfillment option. The Business resolves the conflict, returns the authoritative state, and **MUST** report the change as a `payment_term_changed` warning in `messages[]`. A Business **MUST** also report that warning when changing the selected term in place, by altering its schedules, due dates, or amounts, without naming a different term. A Platform can therefore detect a changed selection from the code alone, rather than by comparing responses.

## Payment instruments and eligibility

This extension does not change how instruments are supplied. The Buyer's instruments fund the checkout under the selected term.

Checkout-specific handler and instrument eligibility is a **runtime result**. Profiles advertise broad support; the Business resolves that support against the Checkout context and any instruments already supplied, then returns the authoritative `ucp.payment_handlers` in the response. This covers cases a discovery-time predicate cannot express — a gift card whose balance is below the deposit, an issuer that will not support a delayed capture for this Business, a credential that expires before the balance comes due.

A Platform therefore cannot pre-compute the effect of a choice, and **MUST** treat the set in each response as authoritative for that response alone. A handler that must be initialized with the amount and timing it will charge cannot be prepared before the term is agreed, and **MAY** cease to be offered once it is.

The instrument funding a term is charged once for each of that term's schedules, and **MUST** be capable of every one of them. A Business **MUST NOT** advertise an instrument that cannot fund every schedule of the selected term, and **MUST** reject one that is submitted. An instrument that can only be charged immediately therefore cannot be offered on a term that defers any part of the payment.

A term with more than one schedule **MUST** be funded by a single instrument. [Split Payments](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment/extensions/split-payments/index.md) composes with a term that has exactly one schedule, and not otherwise.

## Disclosures

Some terms carry display obligations. An installment plan with a finance charge and a deposit that is forfeited on cancellation are both subject to consumer-protection rules about what must be shown, and when.

This extension does not define a private disclosure channel. It uses the two that already exist:

1. A [policy](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/overview/#policies) carries the durable terms text, targeted with `applies_to` at the node the terms concern — the payment term when the terms are about payment timing, the line item when they are about the goods.
1. A `messages[]` warning with `presentation: "disclosure"` and `code` set to that policy's `type` compels display of the notice.

These mechanisms carry durable terms and compel their display. The Business remains responsible for the required content, its applicability, its timing, and any affirmative Buyer acknowledgment. In particular, presenting a policy is optional for a Platform, so any content that **must** reach the Buyer belongs in the warning `content`, not only in the policy `description`.

Disclosure display is unconditional. Under [Warning Presentation](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/shopping/checkout/#warning-presentation) a Platform **MUST** display every returned disclosure, **MUST** keep it in proximity to the node named by `path`, and **MUST NOT** hide, collapse, or auto-dismiss it. A Platform that cannot honor that contract — for example one that collapses a list of terms and so cannot preserve proximity for each — **MUST** escalate through `continue_url` rather than silently dropping the notice.

An obligation disclosed at checkout does not end at checkout: it records money still owed, not context. Where a disclosure governed the term the Buyer accepted, the Business **MUST** return that disclosure on the Order with its `path` set to `$.payment.accepted_term`, and **MUST** use the same target in the `applies_to` of any policy paired with it. A Business **MUST NOT** return disclosures attached to terms the Buyer did not accept.

`applies_to` and `path` resolve against the response they appear in, so a target that named the right node on the Checkout does not necessarily name it on the Order; an Order's line items, for instance, are current-state data whose positions need not match. A Business **MUST** ensure that every target it emits resolves to the intended node on the response that carries it.

## Out of scope

**Amounts that are not determinable at checkout.** A schedule states a known amount due at a stated time. Hotel incidentals, usage overages, and post-purchase true-ups are not payment schedules; they are authorizations and order adjustments.

**Multiple currencies within one term.** Every schedule amount is denominated in the Checkout `currency`, so a term cannot express an obligation payable partly in another currency.

**Recurring commerce.** Schedules settle the current checkout. They do not create future purchases, renewals, or fulfillment obligations.

**Payment execution.** This extension discloses when money is due. It does not define credential storage, future-charge authorization, how a Business executes capture, or mandate requirements, and a Platform **MUST NOT** infer that a deferred payment can be inspected, modified, or cancelled through UCP.

| terms            | Array[object] | Optional    | Payment terms the Buyer can choose from. An unselected term's amounts are indicative; the selected term's schedule amounts sum to the checkout total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| selected_term_id | string        | Optional    | ID of the selected payment term. MUST match one `terms[].id` from the latest Checkout response. Present in a response whenever `terms` is, and absent when it is not: the Checkout total is the selected term's total, so a list of terms without a selection would show an amount that matches no stated term. Where the Buyer has made no choice, the Business selects a default. Omitted on create requests because term IDs are checkout-scoped and no terms exist yet, and on complete requests because the term is already agreed by then. Selecting a term is an Update Checkout mutation: the Business response is authoritative for all derived state. |

### Order Payment

On the Order, `payment` carries the accepted term. The terms offered at checkout are not projected.

The accepted term is the agreement, not a running balance. When the Order is created, a Business **MUST** ensure its schedule amounts sum to the Order `total`. A Business **MUST NOT** modify the accepted term after the Order is created; post-purchase changes are recorded in `adjustments[]`. The schedules can therefore sum to more than the Order currently owes after a refund, or less after an exchange: the term states what was agreed, and the adjustments state what happened after.

Order payment details carrying the term the Buyer accepted at checkout.

Platforms MAY use `type` and `due_at` for enhanced presentation, but MUST NOT present derived timing that contradicts this field.                                                                                                                                                  |

Supplementary to `description`, never a replacement for it. Omitted when the due date depends on a future event (e.g. 'due on delivery'); the timing is then stated in `description` alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| amount      | [Amount](/pr-test/draft/specification/reference/#amount)           | **Required** | The amount charged when this payment is taken, inclusive of tax and every other charge, in the Checkout currency's minor units (ISO 4217). A schedule states an amount rather than a totals breakdown: the purchase is priced once at the Checkout, and a schedule moves part or all of that price. Where the selected term changes what the purchase costs, that difference appears in `checkout.totals`, not here.                                                                                                                |

## Examples

### Lodging: pay now, or deposit and balance at check-in

> A $1,200 stay. Pay in full today for $1,150, or pay the first night now and the balance at check-in.

The two terms have **different payable amounts**. Each term's schedules sum to what that term is payable at, and only the selected one is bound to the checkout total.

**Checkout response fragment — the terms on offer.** The Buyer has not chosen yet, so the Business defaults to paying now, and says so:

```json
{
  "selected_term_id": "pt_pay_now",
  "terms": [
    {
      "id": "pt_pay_now",
      "title": "Pay now",
      "description": { "plain": "Save $50 by paying for your stay today." },
      "schedules": [
        {

The $50 the pay-now term saves is stated where the purchase is priced, as its own entry in `checkout.totals`:

```json
[
  { "type": "subtotal", "amount": 120000 },
  { "type": "discount", "amount": -5000, "display_text": "Pay-now saving" },
  { "type": "total", "amount": 115000 }
]
```

**Update request — the Buyer selects the deposit term:**

```json
{
  "selected_term_id": "pt_deposit_balance"
}

Because the pay-now discount no longer applies, `checkout.totals` reports $1,200 — the sum of the selected term's two schedules — and the `discount` entry that carried the $50 saving is gone. Had the Buyer selected `pt_pay_now`, the checkout total would be $1,150, composed with that entry. The terms are unchanged; only the selected term is bound to the checkout total. `ucp.payment_handlers` in this response is the set resolved for the selected term.

The deposit terms live in a policy that targets the term they apply to:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "com.example.policy.deposit_forfeiture",
    "applies_to": ["$.payment.terms[1]"],
    "description": {
      "plain": "The $300 deposit is non-refundable within 48 hours of arrival."
    }
  }
]
```

On completion, the accepted term travels to the Order, so the Buyer can still see that $900 is due at check-in. The other terms do not travel, and the deposit disclosure moves with the term it governs:

```json

  "ucp": {
    "version": "draft",
    "capabilities": {
      "dev.ucp.shopping.order": [{"version": "draft"}],

    }

          "due_at": "2026-09-01T15:00:00-07:00",
          "amount": 90000
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "policies": [
    {
      "type": "com.example.policy.deposit_forfeiture",
      "applies_to": ["$.payment.accepted_term"],
      "description": {
        "plain": "The $300 deposit is non-refundable within 48 hours of arrival."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The schedules sum to the Order `total`, and the policy that named `$.payment.terms[1]` on the Checkout names `$.payment.accepted_term` here. No representation of `pt_pay_now` survives.

### Installments

> Pay 25% today, then 25% every two weeks.

Four payments and four schedules: one due at completion, and three with computed due dates. The Business does the calendar arithmetic; the Platform reads dates.

```json
{
  "id": "pt_pay_in_4",
  "title": "Pay in 4",
  "description": { "plain": "Four interest-free payments of $25." },
  "schedules": [
    {
      "id": "sched_1",
      "type": "immediate",
      "description": { "plain": "Due today." },
      "amount": 2500
    },
    {
      "id": "sched_2",
      "type": "deferred",
      "description": { "plain": "Due September 15, 2026." },
      "due_at": "2026-09-15T00:00:00Z",
      "amount": 2500
    },
    {
      "id": "sched_3",
      "type": "deferred",
      "description": { "plain": "Due September 29, 2026." },
      "due_at": "2026-09-29T00:00:00Z",
      "amount": 2500
    },
    {
      "id": "sched_4",
      "type": "deferred",
      "description": { "plain": "Due October 13, 2026." },
      "due_at": "2026-10-13T00:00:00Z",
      "amount": 2500
    }
  ]
}
```

## Platform responsibilities

Platforms **MUST**:

- Present each term's `title`, and each schedule's `description` and `amount`, formatted in the Checkout `currency`.
- Re-render from the Business response after selecting a term, rather than reusing amounts read from `terms[]`.
- Treat an unrecognized schedule `type` as not due at completion, and present the term regardless.
- Process disclosures attached to terms per [Warning Presentation](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/shopping/checkout/#warning-presentation), escalating through `continue_url` when the rendering contract cannot be honored.

Platforms **MAY** use `type` and `due_at` for enhanced presentation — calendar views, countdowns, reminders. This is optional; recognizing a `type` never changes what a Platform is required to render.

Platforms **SHOULD**:

- Present terms so the Buyer can compare them before selecting, unless only one term is available or the Checkout is being handed off.

## Business responsibilities

Businesses **MUST**:

- Offer terms where a Checkout has a choice to present or schedules to disclose.
- Name one of the offered terms in `selected_term_id` on every response that carries `terms`.
- Ensure every term's schedules state, in `description` alone, when each payment is due.
- Ensure the selected term's schedule amounts sum to the checkout total exactly once.
- State any difference the selected term makes to what the purchase costs as its own entry in `checkout.totals`.
- Return the recomputed Checkout after a selection, including any change to totals, policies, messages, or eligible payment handlers.
- Report a `payment_term_changed` warning whenever a response changes the term in effect, whether by naming a different term or by rewriting the selected one in place.
- Place any content that must reach the Buyer in the disclosure `content`, not only in the paired policy `description`.
- Carry the accepted term onto the Order as `payment.accepted_term`, along with any disclosure that governed it.

Businesses **SHOULD**:

- Provide `due_at` whenever the due date is determinable at checkout.
- Keep schedule IDs stable across Checkout responses unless the schedule itself changes.
