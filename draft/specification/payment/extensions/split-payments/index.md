# Split Payments Extension

- **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.common.payment.split_payments`

> **Note on examples:** Instrument `type` strings used in this spec (`card`, `gift_card`, `store_credit`, `loyalty`) are illustrative. Only `card` has a normative instrument schema in the base spec (`card_payment_instrument.json`); the others are handler-defined. Credential shapes shown in examples are similarly illustrative — real handlers MUST publish their credential schemas. Each usage example below assumes a business `allowed_combinations` config that admits the instrument set shown; the "Example Configuration" block later in this doc is one such config, not the only one.

## Overview

The Split Payments extension lets buyers pay with more than one payment instrument in a single checkout. Businesses declare the instrument combinations they support in `allowed_combinations`.

Each instrument is submitted in one of two modes:

- **Specified-amount** (`amount` present): the platform requests a specific contribution.
- **Open-amount** (`amount` omitted): the business determines the instrument's contribution at processing time (e.g., by querying a gift card's available balance).

On the response, the business reports the actual amount authorized or charged for each successfully-processed instrument in the same `amount` field. Response `amount` is informational only; see "Response: Actual Charges" below.

All `amount` values are expressed in `checkout.currency` minor units (ISO 4217). Handlers using foreign-currency-denominated instruments (e.g., a CAD gift card in a USD checkout) or non-currency instruments like loyalty points MUST convert each instrument's contribution to the checkout currency.

Instruments are submitted in **allocation priority order** — the first instrument gets first claim on the checkout total, the second gets next claim, and so on. The business MAY process payment authorizations in any order for operational reasons (e.g., gift cards before open-loop cards to minimize reversal costs); array order governs amount allocation, not processing sequence.

## Schema

### Payment Instrument (Split Payments)

When this capability is active, each payment instrument in `checkout.payment.instruments` gains an optional `amount` field.

Payment instrument extended with an optional per-instrument amount for split payments.

| Name            | Type    | Requirement  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id              | string  | **Required** | A unique identifier for this instrument instance. Typically assigned by the platform for instruments it collects. For a business-owned saved instrument returned on an identity-linked response, this identifier is assigned by the business; the platform MUST treat it as an opaque, business-scoped reference, and the business resolves it server-side when the buyer selects it. |
| handler_id      | string  | **Required** | The unique identifier for the handler instance that produced this instrument. This corresponds to the 'id' field in the Payment Handler definition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| type            | string  | **Required** | The broad category of the instrument (e.g., 'card', 'tokenized_card'). Specific schemas will constrain this to a constant value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| billing_address | object  | Optional     | The billing address associated with this payment method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| credential      | object  | Optional     | The base definition for any payment credential. Handlers define specific credential types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| display         | object  | Optional     | Display information for this payment instrument. Each payment instrument schema defines its specific display properties, as outlined by the payment handler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| amount          | integer | Optional     | Contribution amount for this instrument expressed in ISO 4217 minor units of the containing capability object's `currency`. On request: the platform's requested contribution (omit for open-amount). On response: the actual amount authorized or charged (omitted when not finally processed).                                                                                      |

## Configuration

Businesses declare split payments configuration in their profile.

### Business Profile

| Name                 | Type         | Requirement  | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| allowed_combinations | Array[array] | **Required** | Array of valid instrument combinations. Each combination is an array of instrument groups. A payment is valid if it matches any combination. |

#### `allowed_combinations`

An array of valid instrument combinations. Each combination is an array of **instrument groups** -- constraints that together define one valid way to split a payment.

A set of instruments is valid if it matches **any** combination in the array.

#### Instrument Group

Each group within a combination defines a "slot" that accepts certain instrument types:

| Name  | Type          | Requirement  | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| types | Array[string] | **Required** | Instrument types accepted by this group (OR logic). Any listed type qualifies.                                |
| min   | integer       | Optional     | Minimum number of instruments required from this group. Defaults to 0 (optional).                             |
| max   | integer       | Optional     | Maximum number of instruments allowed from this group. Defaults to 1. MUST be greater than or equal to `min`. |

**Matching algorithm:** a submission matches a combination if there exists an assignment of each submitted instrument to exactly one group such that

- the instrument's `type` is in the assigned group's `types`, and
- every group's instrument count falls within its `min` and `max` (inclusive).

The business MAY use any algorithm to find such an assignment; if any valid assignment exists, the combination matches.

#### Example Configuration

A business that supports (a) a card with up to 2 redeemables, (b) up to 5 gift cards alone, and (c) two credit cards:

```json
{
  "capabilities": [{
    "dev.ucp.common.payment.split_payments": [
      {
        "version": "2026-01-23",
        "config": {
          "allowed_combinations": [
            [
              { "types": ["card"], "min": 1, "max": 1 },
              { "types": ["gift_card", "store_credit"], "max": 2 }
            ],
            [
              { "types": ["gift_card"], "min": 1, "max": 5 }
            ],
            [
              { "types": ["card"], "min": 2, "max": 2 }
            ]
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

Reading each combination:

1. **Card + redeemables**: Exactly 1 card (required), plus up to 2 instruments that are either gift cards or store credit (optional). Valid payments: card alone, card + gift card, card + store credit, card + 2 gift cards, etc.
1. **Gift cards only**: 1 to 5 gift cards with no other instrument types.
1. **Two cards**: Exactly 2 credit/debit cards.

## Using Split Payments

### Instrument Processing Model

1. The platform submits instruments in the `payment.instruments` array in allocation priority order.
1. The business MUST derive a contribution for each instrument, in array order:
1. **Specified-amount**: the business MUST authorize for the stated `amount`.
1. **Open-amount**: the business determines the contribution — typically the instrument's full available balance, up to the remaining checkout total after all prior contributions. A zero available balance is a valid $0 contribution, not a failure.

### Error Handling

A split payment either completes fully or has no financial effect. If the business cannot process an instrument with a specified amount, or cannot achieve the final total, the business MUST return `payment_failed` in `messages[]` and MUST void or reverse any authorizations it made. Reversal MAY retry transiently (e.g., to work around acquirer rate limits or a failing void call), but the buyer MUST NOT remain charged for an incomplete split.

At the protocol layer, each request is processed independently — split-payments state does not persist between requests. The business MUST process each request as a fresh, full submission, without reference to prior requests or responses.

> [!NOTE] Each split payments submission is processed as a complete, self-contained request: a modified instrument set is a new submission, requiring a fresh [idempotency key](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/signatures/#replay-protection). Split-payments state — including authorizations — does not persist between submissions; the unwind-on-failure requirement above enforces this.

**Per-instrument reporting:** when a split is incomplete or has failed, the business MUST emit a `payment_failed` error for each failed instrument, with `path` pointing at the instrument. Businesses MAY also emit `info` messages for succeeded instruments to convey positive context (e.g., "Gift card authorized for $10.00") that the platform can surface to the buyer:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "info",
      "path": "$.payment.instruments[0]",
      "content": "Gift card authorized for $10.00."
    },
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "payment_failed",
      "path": "$.payment.instruments[1]",
      "severity": "recoverable",
      "content": "Card declined — insufficient funds."
    }
  ]
}
```

Severity is `recoverable` because the platform's API supports collecting a replacement instrument and re-submitting. This contrasts with `requires_buyer_input`, which is reserved for cases where the API cannot programmatically collect what the merchant needs.

Error conditions:

- If any instrument cannot be processed (invalid credentials, fraud flag, hard decline, expired, insufficient funds), the business MUST return an error. For open-amount instruments, a zero available balance is not a failure.
- If the checkout total cannot be reached after applying all submitted instruments, the business MUST return an error.
- If the sum of all specified `amount` values exceeds the checkout total, the business MUST return an error.
- If the submitted instruments did not match any valid `allowed_combinations`, the business MUST return an error.

### Response: Actual Charges

On the checkout response, the business MUST set `amount` on every instrument that was authorized or charged, reflecting the actual contribution. For open-amount instruments (submitted without `amount`), the business MUST derive and report the actual contribution. The business MUST omit `amount` on all other instruments (e.g., a provisional authorization that was voided when a later instrument failed, or an instrument the business never attempted).

Response `amount` is informational. It conveys what the business processed for buyer-facing UX and audit (e.g., "$10.00 charged to your gift card"). The platform MUST NOT treat prior response `amount` values as preserved state on subsequent requests, and the business MUST NOT rely on the platform echoing them. Each request is fresh intent — the platform sets `amount` to specify a contribution or omits it for open-amount, independent of any prior response.

## Examples

### Gift Card + Credit Card

> "Pay with my gift card first, credit card for the rest."

**Inbound (buyer's selection):**

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "instruments": [
      {
        "id": "pi_gc_1",
        "handler_id": "example_handler_1",
        "type": "gift_card",
        "credential": { "type": "gift_card", "token": "gc_abc123" }
      },
      {
        "id": "pi_card_1",
        "handler_id": "example_handler_1",
        "type": "card",
        "credential": { "type": "card", "token": "tok_visa_xxxx" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Neither instrument includes `amount` — the business determines both.

**Outbound (completed checkout, $50 order):**

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "instruments": [
      {
        "id": "pi_gc_1",
        "handler_id": "example_handler_1",
        "type": "gift_card",
        "credential": { "type": "gift_card", "token": "gc_abc123" },
        "amount": 1000
      },
      {
        "id": "pi_card_1",
        "handler_id": "example_handler_1",
        "type": "card",
        "credential": { "type": "card", "token": "tok_visa_xxxx" },
        "amount": 4000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The business queried the gift card's balance ($10), charged it in full, and charged the credit card for the remaining $40.

### Loyalty Points + Credit Card

> "Use 500 of my 2000 loyalty points ($5 equivalent), credit card for the rest."

**Inbound (buyer's selection):**

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "instruments": [
      {
        "id": "pi_lp_1",
        "handler_id": "example_handler_1",
        "type": "loyalty",
        "credential": { "type": "loyalty", "token": "lp_abc123" },
        "amount": 500
      },
      {
        "id": "pi_card_1",
        "handler_id": "example_handler_1",
        "type": "card",
        "credential": { "type": "card", "token": "tok_visa_xxxx" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The platform specifies `amount: 500` on the loyalty instrument (the customer chose to redeem exactly 500 points). The credit card covers the rest.

**Outbound (completed checkout, $50 order):**

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "instruments": [
      {
        "id": "pi_lp_1",
        "handler_id": "example_handler_1",
        "type": "loyalty",
        "credential": { "type": "loyalty", "token": "lp_abc123" },
        "amount": 500
      },
      {
        "id": "pi_card_1",
        "handler_id": "example_handler_1",
        "type": "card",
        "credential": { "type": "card", "token": "tok_visa_xxxx" },
        "amount": 4500
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The business charged the loyalty points for $5 as requested, and the credit card covers the remaining $45.

### Gift Card + Gift Card + Credit Card (mixed amounts)

> "Use both gift cards, credit card for the rest."

**Inbound:**

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "instruments": [
      {
        "id": "pi_gc_1",
        "handler_id": "handler_gc",
        "type": "gift_card",
        "credential": { "type": "gift_card", "token": "gc_abc123" }
      },
      {
        "id": "pi_gc_2",
        "handler_id": "handler_gc",
        "type": "gift_card",
        "credential": { "type": "gift_card", "token": "gc_def456" }
      },
      {
        "id": "pi_card_1",
        "handler_id": "handler_card",
        "type": "card",
        "credential": { "type": "card", "token": "tok_visa_xxxx" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Outbound (completed checkout, $100 order):**

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "instruments": [
      {
        "id": "pi_gc_1",
        "handler_id": "handler_gc",
        "type": "gift_card",
        "credential": { "type": "gift_card", "token": "gc_abc123" },
        "amount": 2500
      },
      {
        "id": "pi_gc_2",
        "handler_id": "handler_gc",
        "type": "gift_card",
        "credential": { "type": "gift_card", "token": "gc_def456" },
        "amount": 0
      },
      {
        "id": "pi_card_1",
        "handler_id": "handler_card",
        "type": "card",
        "credential": { "type": "card", "token": "tok_visa_xxxx" },
        "amount": 7500
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The first gift card had a $25 balance (charged in full). The second gift card had a $0 balance — this is not an error, it simply contributes nothing. The credit card covers the remaining $75.

### Partial Failure with Recovery

> "Pay with my gift card first, credit card for the rest." — but the credit card declines. The business voids the gift card authorization and signals the platform that the checkout can be retried with a replacement card.

**Outbound (incomplete checkout, $50 order — gift card auth was voided per the atomic invariant):**

```json
{
  "status": "incomplete",
  "payment": {
    "instruments": [
      {
        "id": "pi_gc_1",
        "handler_id": "example_handler_1",
        "type": "gift_card",
        "credential": { "type": "gift_card", "token": "gc_abc123" }
      },
      {
        "id": "pi_card_1",
        "handler_id": "example_handler_1",
        "type": "card",
        "credential": { "type": "card", "token": "tok_visa_xxxx" }
      }
    ]
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "info",
      "path": "$.payment.instruments[0]",
      "content": "Gift card has $10.00 available balance."
    },
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "payment_failed",
      "path": "$.payment.instruments[1]",
      "severity": "recoverable",
      "content": "Card declined — insufficient funds."
    }
  ]
}
```

Both instruments omit `amount` because neither contributed funds — the gift card was provisionally authorized and then voided when the card declined, and the card declined outright. The `info` message conveys the discovered gift card balance so the platform can render accurate buyer UX; the `payment_failed` error identifies the failing instrument with `severity: recoverable`.

**Inbound (platform re-submits with a replacement card, $50 order):**

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "instruments": [
      {
        "id": "pi_gc_1",
        "handler_id": "example_handler_1",
        "type": "gift_card",
        "credential": { "type": "gift_card", "token": "gc_abc123" }
      },
      {
        "id": "pi_card_2",
        "handler_id": "example_handler_1",
        "type": "card",
        "credential": { "type": "card", "token": "tok_visa_yyyy" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The platform submits a new request — the gift card is re-submitted as open-amount and the failing card is replaced. The business processes this as new intent.
