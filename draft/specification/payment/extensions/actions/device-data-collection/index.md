# Payment Device Data Collection Action

This specification defines the device data collection Action type declared by the [Payment Authentication extension](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment/extensions/authentication/index.md):

```text
dev.ucp.common.payment.device_data_collection
```

It asks the Platform to mount an invisible payment-authentication surface to complete device data collection.

## Purpose and Scope

Device data collection lets a Business, payment handler, PSP, or 3DS provider collect device or browser data before payment processing continues. UCP does not carry the collected data. The loaded surface sends provider-specific data directly to the Business or payment provider through its own integration.

For EMV 3DS, this Action represents only the Platform-facing instruction to mount the collection surface. UCP does not define how a Business maps ACS method availability, method timeouts, or collection outcomes into EMVCo state such as `threeDSCompInd`. If a provider or Business skips collection, including when an ACS supplies no method URL, the Business does not emit this Action.

## Blocking Action

A Business **MAY** emit this type from a Create, Update, or Complete Checkout response after it can associate collection with a payment instrument and negotiated payment handler. `config.payment_instrument_id` identifies that instrument.

The Action gates advancement of the associated payment attempt while the occurrence remains outstanding in the authoritative Checkout. A terminal surface event starts reconciliation; it does not itself lift the gate or assert that collection succeeded. If collection is merely an optimization that the Business will not wait for, the Business **MUST NOT** emit an Action.

## Runtime Shape

The Action is emitted under its type key:

```json
{
  "actions": {
    "dev.ucp.common.payment.device_data_collection": [
      {
        "id": "ddc-1",
        "config": {
          "payment_instrument_id": "instrument_1",
          "url": "https://payments.example.com/ucp/payment/ddc/session_123"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The config shape is defined inline by the [Payment Authentication extension schema](/pr-test/draft/schemas/common/payment_authentication.json).

| Field                   | Type   | Required | Notes                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payment_instrument_id` | string | ✓        | ID of the associated instrument in the containing Checkout. |
| `url`                   | string | ✓        | Absolute HTTPS URL for the invisible collection surface.    |

`config.url` **SHOULD** be Business- or provider-operated and own any provider-specific POST, such as posting `threeDSMethodData` to an ACS method URL. The Platform performs an ordinary navigation to it.

## Platform Behavior

The Platform **MUST**:

1. validate the URL according to the Payment Authentication contract, the payment handler and instrument context, and Platform policy;
1. load the URL in an isolated, invisible browser-capable surface;
1. complete the `action.ready` handshake before allowing collection to begin;
1. correlate embedded notifications with both this Action occurrence and the mounted surface; and
1. unmount the surface after `action.done`, `action.error`, load failure, or timeout.

Mounting the surface **MUST** follow the shared [Payment Authentication rendering contract](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment/extensions/authentication/#surface-rendering-and-notifications) and [Embedded Protocol security requirements](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/embedded-protocol/#security).

On the web the surface is typically a hidden iframe. A native Platform may use an isolated webview or equivalent browser surface. It **MUST NOT** be visible to the Buyer or request Buyer interaction.

The Platform distinguishes only whether its surface finished or could not continue. It does not determine whether device data was collected successfully, whether an ACS method timed out, or whether 3DS authentication should proceed.

## Embedded Notifications

After completing the shared [`action.ready` handshake](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment/extensions/authentication/#ready-handshake), the surface sends JSON-RPC 2.0 notifications defined by the [payment Action embedded contract](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment/extensions/authentication/#surface-rendering-and-notifications).

### Done

When the Platform-facing collection step is finished, the surface **MUST** send:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "action.done",
  "params": {
    "id": "ddc-1"
  }
}
```

Handler-owned logic determines when that step is finished. The notification does not reveal whether collection succeeded, was unavailable, was skipped, or mapped to a particular provider completion indicator.

### Error

If the surface cannot continue from the Platform-facing transport perspective, it **MAY** send:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "action.error",
  "params": {
    "id": "ddc-1",
    "error": {
      "ucp": { "version": "draft", "status": "error" },
      "messages": [
        {
          "type": "error",
          "code": "action_unavailable",
          "content": "Device data collection could not start.",
          "severity": "recoverable"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Surface-level codes are the shared [well-known `action.error` codes](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment/extensions/authentication/#surface-rendering-and-notifications). They are not EMV 3DS or payment outcomes: a provider-domain timeout or unavailable method that the handler can safely continue past should normally result in `action.done`, with the Business and provider recording the domain outcome server-side. After either notification, the Platform follows the shared Payment Authentication reconciliation contract.

## Deadline and Fallback

[EMV 3-D Secure Protocol and Core Functions v2.3.1.1](https://www.emvco.com/specifications/emv-3-d-secure-protocol-and-core-functions-specification-6/) requires the 3DS Server to set `threeDSCompInd` to `N` when the 3DS Method does not complete within five seconds (Req 315). That provider-domain timer begins when the method is invoked and remains owned by the Business and provider; the Platform **MUST NOT** derive it from the outer surface's load event.

The Platform applies a bounded outer-surface deadline defined by the handler or Platform policy, measured from navigation and capped by Checkout `expires_at`. That deadline controls only how long the Platform keeps the UCP surface mounted; it does not set `threeDSCompInd` or another provider outcome.

If no valid `action.done` or `action.error` arrives before the outer deadline, the Platform **MUST** unmount the surface, treat the interaction as timed out, and follow the non-successful surface reconciliation path. It may unmount sooner after load failure or a valid terminal notification. The Platform **MUST NOT** remount the same Action type and `id`; an unchanged occurrence follows the parent Checkout Actions fallback, handoff, and cancellation rules.

## Security

The common [Payment Authentication security requirements](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment/extensions/authentication/#security-and-data-handling) apply. In addition:

- The handler's trust policy **MUST** authorize the initial and redirect origins before the Platform loads them.
- The surface **MUST NOT** receive Platform credentials or access Platform storage.
- Provider payloads and collected device data **MUST NOT** be copied into the Action, notification params, Checkout, or payment instrument.
- `action.done` and `action.error` are advisory surface signals. A later Checkout response, based on Business/provider state, remains authoritative.
