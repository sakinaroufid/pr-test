# Payment Handler Specification Guide

## Introduction

This guide defines the standard structure and vocabulary for specifying UCP payment handlers. All payment handler specifications **SHOULD** follow this structure to ensure consistency, completeness, and clarity for implementers.

### Purpose

Payment handlers enable "N-to-N" interoperability between platforms, businesses, and payment providers. A well-specified handler must answer these questions for each participant:

- **Who participates?** What participants are involved and what are their roles?
- **What are the prerequisites?** What onboarding or setup is required?
- **How is it configured?** What configuration is advertised or consumed?
- **How is it executed?** What protocol is followed to acquire or process instruments?

This guide provides a framework that ensures every handler specification answers these questions systematically.

### Scope

This guide applies to:

- **Handlers** (e.g., `com.google.pay`, `dev.shopify.shop_pay`) — Specific payment method implementations

______________________________________________________________________

## Core Concepts

Every payment handler specification **MUST** define the core elements below.

**Note on Protocol Signatures:**: The function signatures provided in this section (e.g., `PROCESSING(...)`) represent **logical data flows**, not literal function calls. Spec authors must map these logical flows to the actual transport protocol used by their implementation.

### Participants

**Definition:** The distinct actors that participate in the payment handler's lifecycle. Every handler has at minimum two participants (business and platform), but **MAY** define additional participants with specific roles.

**Note on Terminology:**: While this guide refers to the participant as the **"Business"**, technical schema fields may retain the standard industry nomenclature **`merchant_*`** (e.g., `merchant_id`, `merchant_name`). Specifications **MUST** explicitly document these field mappings.

**Standard Participants:**

| Participant  | Role                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Business** | Advertises handler configuration, processes payment instruments    |
| **Platform** | Discovers handlers, acquires payment instruments, submits checkout |

**Extended Participants** (example handler-specific participants):

| Participant   | Example Role                                                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tokenizer** | Stores raw credentials and issues token credentials                    |
| **PSP**       | Processes payments on behalf of business using the checkout instrument |

### Prerequisites

**Definition:** The onboarding, setup, or configuration a participant must complete before participating in the handler's flows.

**Signature:**

```text
PREREQUISITES(participant, onboarding_input) → prerequisites_output
```

| Field                  | Description                                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `participant`          | The participant being onboarded (business, platform, etc.) |
| `onboarding_input`     | What the participant provides during setup                 |
| `prerequisites_output` | The identity and any additional configuration received     |

**Prerequisites Output:**

The `prerequisites_output` contains what a participant receives from onboarding. At minimum, this includes an **identity** (see [Payment Identity](/pr-test/draft/schemas/common/types/payment_identity.json)). It **MAY** also include additional configuration, credentials, or settings specific to the handler.

Payment handler specifications **are not required** to define a formal schema for `prerequisites_output`. Instead, the specification **SHOULD** clearly document:

- What identity is assigned (and how it maps to `PaymentIdentity`)
- What additional configuration is provided
- How the prerequisites output is used in Handler Declaration, Instrument Acquisition, or Processing

**Notes:**

- Prerequisites typically occur out-of-band (portals, contracts, API calls)
- Multiple participants **MAY** have independent prerequisites
- The identity from prerequisites typically appears within the handler's `config` object (e.g., as `merchant_id` or similar handler-specific field)
- Participants receiving raw credentials (e.g., businesses, PSPs) typically must complete security acknowledgements during onboarding, accepting responsibility for credential handling and compliance

### Handler Declaration

**Definition:** The configuration a business advertises to indicate support for this handler and enable platforms to invoke it.

**Signature:**

```text
HANDLER_DECLARATION(prerequisites_output) → handler_declaration
```

| Field                  | Description                                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prerequisites_output` | The identity and configuration from business prerequisites |
| `handler_declaration`  | The handler object advertised in `ucp.payment_handlers`    |

**Output Structure:**

The handler declaration conforms to the [`PaymentHandler`](/pr-test/draft/schemas/payment_handler.json) schema. The specification **SHOULD** define the available config and instrument schemas, and how to construct each based on the business's prerequisites output and desired configuration.

```json
{
  "com.example.handler": [
    {
      "id": "processor_tokenizer_1234",
      "version": "draft",
      "spec": "https://example.com/ucp/handler",
      "schema": "https://example.com/ucp/handler/schema.json",
      "available_instruments": [ ... ],
      "config": {
        // Handler-specific configuration (see Config Shapes)
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**`available_instruments`** is optional. When absent, the handler places no restrictions on instrument types or constraints — it supports the full set of instrument types defined by its handler schema. When present, it narrows the advertised types and/or applies additional constraints (e.g., limiting card brands to `visa` and `mastercard`). In a Business profile and authoritative response, array order communicates preferred instrument presentation, earliest first.

Each entry narrows along two axes. Both are [Constraint Expressions](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/overview/#constraint-expression), so one evaluator runs both; they differ only in the object they describe:

```text
available_instruments[]
├── type                       selects an instrument schema
├── constraints                describes that schema's `constraint_target`
└── ucp.request_constraints    describes the request that submits it, via `path`
```

`constraints` admits no `path`. Its object is standing, not selected: the instrument schema for the entry's `type` declares it as `$defs/constraint_target`, and keys in `properties` name that object's members. The target holds what the Business derives rather than receives — for cards, `brand`, read from the account number and surviving tokenization — which is why those values cannot be expressed as requirements on request data.

`ucp.request_constraints` carries everything that *is* on the wire: which instrument fields are required, which credential types are accepted, and which fields each of those credential types must carry. Use field requirements rather than handler-specific booleans for modeled data.

When an authoritative response includes `ucp.request_constraints` on an available instrument, the Business **MUST** include an explicit `path` because the available instrument's response Normalized Path does not identify submitted instruments. The path matches the containing handler's `id` to submitted `handler_id` and the available instrument's `type` to submitted `type`, and applies when the next request contains matching instruments. Payment-handler and instrument specifications define any stronger association the query needs. See [Request Constraints](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/overview/#request-constraints).

One path selects the submitted instrument, and one Constraint Expression describes it. Requirements shared by every instrument of the type are sibling members; requirements that differ per credential family are `anyOf` branches on the nested `credential` object. Splitting the credential families into distinct schemas is what gives each branch a stable discriminator.

```json
{
  "id": "processor_tokenizer_1234",
  "version": "draft",
  "available_instruments": [
    {
      "type": "card",
      "constraints": { "properties": { "brand": { "enum": ["visa", "mastercard"] } } },
      "ucp": {
        "request_constraints": {
          "path": "$['payment']['instruments'][?@['handler_id'] == 'processor_tokenizer_1234' && @['type'] == 'card']",
          "required": ["billing_address", "credential"],
          "properties": {
            "billing_address": { "required": ["postal_code", "address_country"] },
            "credential": {
              "anyOf": [
                { "properties": { "type": { "const": "pan" } }, "required": ["cvc"] },
                { "properties": { "type": { "const": "network_token" } } }
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The sibling members apply to every card instrument from this handler. The branches accept either a PAN credential carrying a `cvc` or a network token, which `network_token_credential.json` already requires to carry a `cryptogram`; a credential of any other type satisfies neither branch. Declared constraints are the upfront minimum; dynamic requirements still use recoverable errors and [`message_error.path`](/pr-test/draft/schemas/common/types/message_error.json).

#### Handler Declaration Variants

The `PaymentHandler` schema defines three variants for different contexts. While only `id` and `version` are technically required, each variant serves a distinct purpose and typically includes different configuration:

| Variant             | Context                                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **business_schema** | Business discovery (`/.well-known/ucp`) | Declares the business identity and how they're configured for this handler. Contains merchant-specific settings.                                                                                                                               |
| **platform_schema** | Platform profile (advertised URI)       | Declares the platform identity and how it supports this handler. Includes `spec` and `schema` URLs for implementers.                                                                                                                           |
| **response_schema** | Checkout/Order API responses            | **Runtime configuration** with resolved context: merchant identity, resolved `available_instruments` for this checkout, tokenization specs, and other state needed to process the transaction. Platforms **MUST** treat this as authoritative. |

**Business Schema Example** (business declares handler configuration):

```json
{
  "id": "processor_tokenizer_1234",
  "version": "draft",
  "spec": "https://example.com/ucp/handler",
  "schema": "https://example.com/ucp/handler/schema.json",
  "available_instruments": [
    {
      "type": "card",
      "constraints": {
        "properties": { "brand": { "enum": ["visa", "mastercard"] } }
      }
    }
  ],
  "config": {
    "environment": "production",
    "business_id": "business_xyz_789"
  }
}
```

**Platform Schema Example** (platform declares handler support):

```json
{
  "id": "platform_tokenizer_2345", // note: ids are for disambiguation, they may differ between business and platform
  "version": "draft",
  "spec": "https://example.com/ucp/handler",
  "schema": "https://example.com/ucp/handler/schema.json",
  "available_instruments": [
    {
      "type": "card",
      "constraints": {
        "properties": { "brand": { "enum": ["visa", "mastercard", "amex", "discover"] } }
      }
    }
  ],
  "config": {
    "environment": "production",
    "platform_id": "platform_abc_123"
  }
}
```

**Response Schema Example** (runtime context for checkout):

```json
{
  "id": "processor_tokenizer_1234",
  "version": "draft",
  "available_instruments": [
    {
      "type": "card",
      "constraints": {
        "properties": { "brand": { "enum": ["visa", "mastercard"] } }
      }
    }
  ],
  "config": {
    "api_version": 2,
    "environment": "production",
    "business_id": "business_xyz_789"
  }
}
```

#### Resolving `available_instruments`

Both the platform and the business independently advertise `available_instruments` in their profiles. The business is responsible for resolving these into the authoritative value returned in the `response_schema`.

**Resolution flow:**

1. **Platform declares capabilities** — the platform's profile includes `available_instruments` on each handler declaration. This tells the business what the platform can handle (e.g., it only supports `["visa", "mastercard", "amex", "discover"]`).
1. **Business resolves** — upon receiving a request, the business computes the resolved `available_instruments` for the checkout by intersecting:
1. The platform's advertised `available_instruments` (its capabilities)
1. Its own `business_schema` declaration (what the merchant is actually set up to accept)
1. Cart/checkout context (e.g., certain item types may restrict eligible methods)
1. **Response is authoritative** — the `available_instruments` in the `response_schema` reflects the business's resolved selection for this specific checkout. Platforms **MUST** treat it as authoritative and **MUST NOT** attempt to use instrument types or apply constraints that contradict it.

**Example:**

| Source                  | `available_instruments`                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Platform profile        | `[{type: "card", constraints: {properties: {brand: {enum: ["visa", "mastercard", "amex", "discover"]}}}}]` |
| Business profile        | `[{type: "card", constraints: {properties: {brand: {enum: ["visa", "mastercard", "amex"]}}}}]`             |
| **Response (resolved)** | `[{type: "card", constraints: {properties: {brand: {enum: ["visa", "mastercard", "amex"]}}}}]`             |

In this example, the business's PSP is not configured for Discover, so Discover is excluded from the response even though the platform supports it.

______________________________________________________________________

#### Defining the Schema

The `schema` field points to a JSON schema that defines handler-specific shapes. Authors typically define each shape in its own file and reference them:

- **Config** — Configuration for platform/business declarations and runtime responses
- **Instrument** — The payment instrument structure returned to platforms
- **Credential** — The credential structure within instruments

**Example Handler Schema:**

```json

          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Config Shapes

Each variant has its own config schema tailored to its context:

| Variant             | Config File                  | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **business_schema** | `types/business_config.json` | Business identity and merchant-specific settings   |
| **platform_schema** | `types/platform_config.json` | Platform identity and platform-level settings      |
| **response_schema** | `types/response_config.json` | Full runtime state: identities, tokenization specs |

**Example `types/business_config.json`:**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://example.com/ucp/handlers/tokenizer/types/business_config.json",

    },
    "business_id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Business identifier for this handler."
    }
  }

#### Instrument Shapes

**Base Instrument Schemas:**

| Schema                                                                                             | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`payment_instrument.json`](/pr-test/draft/schemas/common/types/payment_instrument.json)           | Base: id, handler_id, type, billing_address, credential, display |
| [`card_payment_instrument.json`](/pr-test/draft/schemas/common/types/card_payment_instrument.json) | Extends base with display: brand, last_digits, expiry, card art  |

UCP provides base schemas for universal payment instruments like `card`. Spec authors **MAY** extend any of the base instruments to add handler-specific display data or customize the credential reference. Handlers **MAY** define multiple instrument types for different payment flows.

**Constraint Targets:**

An instrument schema declares what its availability constraints may name in `$defs/constraint_target`: a plain object of members and their types, never carried in a payload. The handler's `payment_instrument` set binds each `type` to the schema that owns its target. [`card_payment_instrument.json`](/pr-test/draft/schemas/common/types/card_payment_instrument.json) declares `brand` as a string, so `{ "properties": { "brand": { "enum": ["visa", "mastercard"] } } }` names a declared member and pins it to string values. The base Payment Handler validates the grammar, so a malformed `constraints` fails everywhere; the target supplies the meaning, so naming an undeclared member or pinning the wrong type is reportable without the base dispatching on `type`. A handler extending an instrument **SHOULD** extend that instrument's target rather than restate it.

**Example `types/tokenizer_instrument.json`**:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://example.com/ucp/handlers/tokenizer/types/tokenizer_instrument.json",

            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },

  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "https://ucp.dev/draft/schemas/common/types/card_payment_instrument.json" }
  ],
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["type"],
  "properties": {
    "type": { "const": "tokenizer_card" },
    "credential": {
      "oneOf": [
        { "$ref": "tokenizer_token.json" },
        { "$ref": "tokenizer_alt_token.json" }
      ]
    },
    "special_tokenizer_context": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Handler-specific context for tokenizer instruments."
    }
  }
}
```

**Example `types/tokenizer_alt_instrument.json`:**

```json

    }
  }
}

#### Credential Shapes

**Base Credential Schemas:**

| Schema                                                                                               | Description                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [`payment_credential.json`](/pr-test/draft/schemas/common/types/payment_credential.json)             | Base: type discriminator only               |
| [`token_credential.json`](/pr-test/draft/schemas/common/types/token_credential.json)                 | Token: type + token string                  |
| [`pan_credential.json`](/pr-test/draft/schemas/common/types/pan_credential.json)                     | Raw FPAN, verified with `cvc`. Source only. |
| [`network_token_credential.json`](/pr-test/draft/schemas/common/types/network_token_credential.json) | Network token, verified with `cryptogram`   |

UCP provides base schemas for universal payment credentials. Authors **MAY** extend these schemas to include handler-specific credential context. Handlers **MAY** define multiple credential types for different instrument flows.

The specification **MUST** define which credential types are accepted by the handler.

**Important:** If using token credentials, the schema **MUST** include an expiration field (`expiry`, `ttl`, or similar) to ensure platforms know when to refresh credentials.

**Example `types/tokenizer_token.json`** (expiring token):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://example.com/ucp/handlers/tokenizer/types/tokenizer_token.json",
  "title": "Tokenizer Card Token",
  "description": "Card token credential for com.example.tokenizer.",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "https://ucp.dev/draft/schemas/common/types/token_credential.json" }
  ],
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["type", "token", "expiry"],
  "properties": {
    "type": {
      "const": "tokenizer_card_token",
      "description": "Credential type discriminator."
    },
    "expiry": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time",
      "description": "Token expiration. Platforms must refresh before this time."
    }
  }
}
```

**Example `types/tokenizer_alt_token.json`** (alt token):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://example.com/ucp/handlers/tokenizer/types/tokenizer_alt_token.json",
  "title": "Tokenizer Alt Token",
  "description": "Alt token credential for com.example.tokenizer, adding routing hints",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "https://ucp.dev/draft/schemas/common/types/token_credential.json" }
  ],
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["type", "token", "expiry"],
  "properties": {
    "type": {
      "const": "tokenizer_alt_token",
      "description": "Credential type discriminator."
    },
    "expiry": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time",
      "description": "Token expiration. Platforms must refresh before this time."
    },
    "routing_hint": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Optional routing number hint."
    }
  }
}
```

### Instrument Acquisition

**Definition:** The protocol a platform follows to acquire a payment instrument that can be submitted to the business's checkout.

**Signature:**

```text
INSTRUMENT_ACQUISITION(
  platform_prerequisites_output,
  handler_declaration,
  binding,
  buyer_input
) → checkout_instrument
```

| Field                           | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `platform_prerequisites_output` | platform's prerequisites output (config), if prerequisites were required       |
| `handler_declaration.config`    | Handler-specific configuration from the business                               |
| `binding`                       | **(See 2.6)** Context binding the credential to a specific capability resource |
| `buyer_input`                   | Buyer's payment selection or credentials                                       |
| `checkout_instrument`           | The payment instrument to submit at checkout                                   |

Payment handler specifications do NOT need to define a formal process for instrument acquisition. Instead, the specification **SHOULD** clearly document:

- How to apply the handler's `config` to construct a valid `checkout_instrument`.
- How to create an effective credential binding to the specific capability resource, which is critical for security, based on the available `config` and `binding`.

### Payment Actions

A payment handler may require the Platform to perform additional work while the Business processes an instrument. The Business returns that work in the Checkout's `actions` map.

Handler authors have two options:

- **Use the standard Payment Authentication extension.** Handlers that need device data collection or a 3DS challenge use [`dev.ucp.common.payment.authentication`](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment/extensions/authentication/index.md), which defines the `dev.ucp.common.payment.device_data_collection` and `dev.ucp.common.payment.three_ds_challenge` Action types. The handler specification states which types it can cause and any provider-specific trust or fallback requirements, such as allowed origins.
- **Define handler-specific Actions.** When the standard types do not fit, the handler author publishes a Checkout extension that declares its Action type keys and `config` shapes. Both the Business and Platform advertise that extension before those Actions are emitted.

For each handler-specific Action, document when it is emitted, the exact effect its type gates, how the Platform processes its config, how the Business observes its completion, whether processing the same occurrence is ever safe to retry, and its trust, failure, abandonment, and fallback behavior.

See [Overview — Actions](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/overview/#actions) for the common envelope and [Schema Authoring — Extension-Declared Action Types](/documentation/schema-authoring/#extension-declared-action-types) for the extension schema pattern.

### Processing

**Definition:** The steps a participant (typically business or PSP) takes to process a received payment instrument and complete the transaction.

**Signature:**

```text
PROCESSING(
  identity,
  checkout_instrument,
  binding,
  transaction_context
) → processing_result
```

| Field                 | Description                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `identity`            | The processing participant's `PaymentIdentity` |
| `checkout_instrument` | The instrument received from the platform      |
| `binding`             | The binding context for verification           |
| `transaction_context` | Checkout totals, line items, etc.              |
| `processing_result`   | Success/failure with payment details           |

#### Error Handling

The specification **MUST** define a mapping for common failures (e.g., 'Declined', 'Insufficient Funds', 'Network Error') to standard UCP Error definitions. This ensures the platform can render localized, consistent error messages to the buyer regardless of the underlying processor.

### Key Definitions

| Term        | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Binding** | A logical association of a payment instrument to a specific capability resource, identified by `type` and `id`. This prevents replay attacks where a credential intended for one resource is intercepted and used against another. Distinct from the participant a token is issued to. |

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to create high-quality, maintainable handler specifications:

### Schema Design

| Practice                         | Description                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Extend, don't reinvent**       | Use `allOf` to compose base schemas. Don't redefine `brand`, `last_digits`, etc.        |
| **Use const for discriminators** | Define `credential.type` as a `const` to identify credential types unambiguously.       |
| **Validate early**               | Publish schemas at stable URLs before finalizing the spec so implementers can validate. |
| **Include Expiry**               | When designing token credentials, always include `expiry` or `ttl`.                     |

### Documentation

| Practice                  | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Show, don't just tell** | Include complete JSON examples for every schema and protocol step.     |
| **Document error cases**  | Specify what errors can occur and how participants should handle them. |
| **Version independently** | The handler version evolves independently of UCP core versions.        |

### Security

| Practice                         | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Require binding**              | Always tie credentials to a specific capability resource via `binding`.        |
| **Minimize credential exposure** | Design flows so raw credentials (PANs, etc.) touch as few systems as possible. |
| **Specify token lifetimes**      | Document whether tokens are single-use, time-limited, or session-scoped.       |

### Maintainability

| Practice                        | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Host schemas at stable URLs** | Schema URLs should not change; use versioned paths if needed.                                                                                                             |
| **Fail gracefully**             | Define clear error responses for common failure scenarios.                                                                                                                |
| **Link to examples**            | Reference existing handler specs and the [Tokenization Guide](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/payment/tokenization/index.md) for common flows. |
