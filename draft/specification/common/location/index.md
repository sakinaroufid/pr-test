# Location Capability

The Location capability allows Platforms to discover, search, and retrieve physical Locations (such as retail stores, restaurants, and brand lockers) from Businesses.

This is vertical-agnostic and enables key commerce flows such as:

- **Local Pickup Discovery**: Finding nearby Locations such as retail stores or restaurant branches that support Buyer pickup, checking their operating hours, and discovering where selected items are currently available before selection.
- **Fulfillment Area Verification**: Checking if a specific location (e.g., utility depot, restaurant, or local service provider) can serve a Buyer's address (the `serves` relation).

| [`dev.ucp.common.location.search`](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/search/index.md) | Search for Locations using free-text queries, explicit spatial relations (`distance`, `serves`), and filters (`hours`, `amenities`, and `items`). |
| [`dev.ucp.common.location.lookup`](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/lookup/index.md) | Retrieve full details for one or more Locations by identifier, optionally refined by the same relations and filters.                              |

## Key Concepts

- **Location**: A physical entity that can be found on a map. Defined by a display name, address, operating hours, and **geographic context** (geographic coordinates).
- **Amenities**: Static features, services, or capabilities of the Location. Responses use a map with reverse-DNS amenity identifiers as keys, combining collision-resistant names, one entry per identifier, and buyer-facing descriptions that keep custom amenities renderable. See [Amenity Vocabulary](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/search/#amenity-vocabulary).
- **Item Availability**: The `items` filter asks whether the Business can currently provide every referenced item at a candidate Location. Returning the Location is a coarse, provisional assertion, not item-level detail or a reservation. See [Item Availability Filter](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/search/#item-availability-filter).
- **Proximity & Serviceability**: Two distinct, explicit spatial relations:
  - **`distance`**: Compares a Location's coordinates against a Platform-supplied center point and inclusive radius.
  - **`serves`**: Asks whether the Location can provisionally serve one explicit Platform-supplied target; the Business is authoritative for that answer, and UCP does not model or expose the underlying coverage geometry — a Location does not implicitly carry a geometric boundary around its coordinates. See [Spatial Relations](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/search/#spatial-relations).
- **Operating Hours**: Regular weekly schedules (`hours`) and date-specific exceptions (`exception_hours`), interpreted in the Location's `timezone`. See [Operating Hours](#operating-hours).

### Relationship to Other Capabilities

The Location capability provides the foundation for localized commerce by integrating tightly with other capabilities (like Catalog, Cart, and Checkout in Shopping):

1. **Stable Identifiers**: Location Search and Lookup return stable, Business-scoped `Location.id` values representing physical entities. A Location ID selects only the physical entity; it does not determine the interaction mode, guarantee availability, or bind operational terms. Downstream capabilities authoritatively negotiate and revalidate all terms during transaction processing (for example, a returned ID submitted as `selected_destination_id`; see [Selection and Location Identity](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/shopping/extensions/fulfillment/#selection-and-location-identity)).
1. **Separation of Discovery Concerns**: Each capability answers one narrow question, and later stages revalidate earlier signals. Location answers which places can currently provide a set of referenced items (the [`items` filter](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/search/#item-availability-filter)).
1. **Provisional vs. Authoritative Boundaries**:
   - *Discovery Phase (Provisional)*: Location responses based on operating hours, current item availability, and amenities represent the Business's *current terms* at the time of query. They are **provisional signals** and are not binding commitments.
   - *Checkout Phase (Authoritative)*: Final transaction terms that depend on a location (e.g., pickup) **MUST** be negotiated and finalized authoritatively. Discovery signals **SHOULD NOT** be cached or reused across sessions without re-validation.

## Operating Hours

### Representation

The hours filter's [`open_at`](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/search/#hours-based-filter) value is an exact instant. Operating hours use the Location's local date and clock time, interpreted using its IANA timezone.

- `hours` is a list of regular weekly intervals. Each item contains `day`, `opens`, and `closes`. `day` is a stable UCP day-of-week identifier for the day on which the interval begins, not localized display text. A Platform **MAY** localize it for presentation. Times use 24-hour `HH:MM` form.
- `exception_hours` is a list of date-specific timed intervals or full closures. Each item contains inclusive local-date bounds `valid_from` and `valid_through` in `YYYY-MM-DD` form; equal bounds select one date. Both `opens` and `closes` define a timed interval, while omitting both defines a full closure. The optional `title` is a short, human-readable heading. It is presentation metadata and does not affect schedule evaluation.
- `timezone` identifies the Business-owned canonical local civil-time frame for both schedules.

### Evaluation

Timed intervals are open at `opens` and closed at `closes`. For example, `10:00`–`17:00` is open immediately before `17:00` and closed at `17:00`. If `closes` is earlier than `opens`, the interval continues into the next local date. As a reserved exception to this closing-boundary rule, the exact `00:00`–`23:59` pair represents the entire local civil date, including daylight saving time transitions. Every pair with equal `opens` and `closes` is invalid, including `00:00`–`00:00`.

Schedule evaluation is deterministic for each instant: convert the instant to the Location's local date, day of week, and time using `timezone`, then apply the effective schedule to those local values. During a forward daylight saving time (DST) transition, local clock labels in the gap correspond to no instants and are not shifted. During a backward DST transition, both instants in the fold that map to the same repeated local time receive the same schedule result. The current schedule shape cannot distinguish the two fold occurrences.

Multiple `hours` items for the same `day` combine as split shifts. An omitted day means no regular interval begins that day, but an interval from the preceding day can carry into it. Absent `hours` means the regular schedule is unknown, not closed. To represent a temporary full closure, a Business retains its regular `hours` and adds an `exception_hours` entry for the affected dates without `opens` or `closes`.

An exception schedule replaces the regular schedule on every covered local date. If an interval carries into a local date governed by an exception, that exception takes authority at local midnight. Intersecting non-identical exception ranges are invalid, including when one contains another. Timed entries with identical bounds can coexist as split shifts, but a full closure stands alone for its bounds. Array order establishes no precedence.

#### Exception hours example

```json
{
  "id": "loc_downtown",
  "name": "Downtown Store",
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "exception_hours": [
    {
      "title": "Holiday hours",
      "valid_from": "2026-12-24",
      "valid_through": "2026-12-26",
      "opens": "10:00",
      "closes": "14:00"
    },
    {
      "title": "Holiday hours",
      "valid_from": "2026-12-24",
      "valid_through": "2026-12-26",
      "opens": "16:00",
      "closes": "18:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

The two entries share date bounds, so they define split shifts that apply independently on each date in the inclusive range. A full closure instead uses one item that omits both `opens` and `closes`.

### Guidelines

#### Business

A Business owns each Location's canonical schedule frame. When a Business emits `hours` or `exception_hours`, it **MUST** express every `day`, `opens`, `closes`, `valid_from`, and `valid_through` value in that frame and **MUST** include `timezone` as a valid [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) identifier. A Business **MUST NOT** vary the canonical schedule frame according to the requesting Platform's or Buyer's timezone. Because JSON Schema does not enforce every semantic constraint, a Business **MUST** emit only schedules that follow the rules above, including unequal `opens` and `closes`, a `valid_from` value no later than `valid_through`, and valid exception-range intersections. A Business **SHOULD** omit an `exception_hours` entry once it can no longer affect the schedule at any current or future instant. It **SHOULD** publish known future exceptions through the planning horizon for which its schedule is authoritative.

#### Platform

When evaluating a returned schedule, a Platform **MUST** use the returned Location's `timezone`. A Platform **MAY** convert concrete dated occurrences to another timezone for presentation, but it **MUST NOT** reinterpret the canonical schedule values in another timezone. A Platform **MUST NOT** infer that a Location with absent, invalid, or otherwise unusable schedule data is open. A Platform **MAY** present `title` according to its presentation policy and **MUST NOT** use it to determine whether a Location is open or closed.

## Shared Entities

### Amenity

Location responses represent amenities as a map keyed by amenity identifier. The Business **MUST** provide a nonempty, plain-text, buyer-facing `description` for every entry. The Business **SHOULD** make it a short, self-contained label or phrase suitable for direct use in a compact list and **SHOULD** localize it for the request when possible. It does not participate in amenity identity or filtering. An entry without that description is schema-invalid; a Platform **MUST** reject the invalid response rather than infer presentation text from the key.

Amenity presentation is identifier-agnostic: the Business-provided `description` alone is sufficient to present any amenity. A Platform governs its own presentation policy and **MAY** decide whether and where amenities appear (for example, omitting them on a compact summary card). When it presents amenities, it **SHOULD** use the provided `description` for every entry it presents and **MUST NOT** suppress an entry solely because its identifier is unrecognized. A Platform **MAY** enhance recognized amenities with icons, grouping, or other structured presentation, but **MUST NOT** infer semantics from an unrecognized identifier or treat it as equivalent to another amenity.

Buyer-facing presentation metadata for one amenity identifier. The containing map key, not this metadata, defines amenity identity and filter matching.

| Name        | Type   | Requirement  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| description | string | **Required** | Short, plain-text, buyer-facing label or phrase for the amenity, suitable for direct use in a compact list (e.g., 'Curbside pickup'). The Business SHOULD localize it for the request when possible. This content does not participate in amenity identity or filter matching. |

### Context

Buyer location and market context for the operations. All fields are optional hints for relevance and localization. Platforms **MAY** geo-detect context from request headers.

Context signals are provisional—not authoritative data. A Business **MAY** use them to influence ranking, localization, or selection of a bounded default browse page, and **MAY** ignore or down-rank them if inconsistent with higher-confidence signals (authenticated account, risk detection). A Business **MUST NOT** substitute them for explicit `distance` or `serves` operands or for `filters.items` item identifiers; they prove neither proximity, serviceability, nor item availability (see [Request Grammar](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/search/#request-grammar)).

### Signals

Environment data provided by the Platform to support authorization and abuse prevention. Signal values **MUST NOT** be buyer-asserted claims. See [Signals](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/overview/#signals) for details and privacy requirements.

| Name               | Type   | Requirement | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| dev.ucp.buyer_ip   | string | Optional    | Client's IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).            |
| dev.ucp.user_agent | string | Optional    | Client's HTTP User-Agent header or equivalent. |

## Messages and Error Handling

All Location responses include an optional `messages` array that allows Businesses to provide context about errors, warnings, or informational notices.

### Message Types

Messages communicate business outcomes and provide context:

'recoverable': platform can resolve the condition in band, for example by modifying inputs or processing a related Action, and submit a new operation when needed. 'requires_buyer_input': merchant requires information their API doesn't support collecting programmatically (checkout incomplete). 'requires_buyer_review': buyer must authorize before order placement due to policy, regulatory, or entitlement rules. 'unrecoverable': no valid resource exists to act on, retry with new resource or inputs.

### Common Scenarios

#### Empty Search

When a valid Search finds no matches, the Business **MUST** return an empty `locations` array. No message is required for an ordinary non-match, including when a `filters.items` identifier is unknown, is unavailable, or cannot be evaluated.

```json
{
  "ucp": {...},
  "locations": []
}
```

An ordinary empty result is not an error: the query was valid but returned no matching Locations.

## Transport Bindings

The capabilities above are bound to specific transport protocols:

- [REST Binding](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/rest/index.md): RESTful API mapping.
- [MCP Binding](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/mcp/index.md): Model Context Protocol mapping via JSON-RPC.

## Security & Privacy Considerations

1. **Coarse-by-default**: Platforms **SHOULD** default to sending coarse location hints (e.g., postal code or rounded coordinates) during the discovery phase. Precise locations/coordinates **SHOULD** only be shared when the Buyer explicitly consents or selects a specific Location.
1. **Availability Probing Mitigation**: Businesses **SHOULD** rate-limit requests carrying `filters.items` to reduce item-availability probing and aggressive enumeration of the directory.
1. **Private/Dark Locations**: Businesses **MUST** filter out internal-only or non-Buyer-accessible locations (e.g., dark kitchens, fulfillment-only hubs) from search results.
1. **Physical Address Spoofing (Integrity)**: While location discovery is read-only, tampering with physical addresses in responses (e.g., through MITM attacks) poses a physical safety/fraud risk. Platforms **SHOULD** verify signatures on location payloads before rendering them to Buyers.
1. **Data Retention & Logging Sanitization**: Businesses **MUST NOT** persist precise location inputs beyond the lifecycle of the request, unless explicit Buyer consent is collected. Server logs should sanitize coordinate inputs by truncating decimal places (e.g., to 2 decimal places, ~1km accuracy) to prevent accidental storage of precise Buyer history.
