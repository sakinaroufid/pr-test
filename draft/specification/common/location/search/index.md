# Location Search Capability

- **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.common.location.search`

Performs a search for physical locations (e.g., retail stores, restaurants, warehouses). Supports free-text queries, explicit `distance` and `serves` relations, and structured filtering by operating hours, amenities, and current item availability.

## Operation

| Operation            | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Search Locations** | Search for Locations using query text, explicit spatial relations, context, and filters. |

### Request

Request body for location search. The `distance` and `serves` relations and every supplied `filters` predicate combine with AND; `query` does not relax them.

| Name       | Type   | Requirement | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| query      | string | Optional    | Free-text search query for natural language location search (e.g., 'restaurants near me that deliver', 'hotels with pool').                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| context    | object | Optional    | Provisional buyer signals for relevance and localization—not authoritative data. Businesses SHOULD use these values when verified inputs (e.g., shipping address) are absent, and MAY ignore or down-rank them if inconsistent with higher-confidence signals (authenticated account, risk detection) or regulatory constraints (export controls). Eligibility and policy enforcement MUST occur at checkout time using binding transaction data. Context SHOULD be non-identifying and can be disclosed progressively—coarse signals early, finer resolution as the session progresses. Higher-resolution data (shipping address, billing address) supersedes context. |
| signals    | object | Optional    | Environment data provided by the platform to support authorization and abuse prevention. Values MUST NOT be buyer-asserted claims — platforms provide signals based on direct observation or independently verifiable third-party attestations. All signal keys MUST use reverse-domain naming to ensure provenance and prevent collisions when multiple extensions contribute to the shared namespace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| distance   | object | Optional    | Optional explicit-center radius predicate. When present, it combines with `serves` and every supplied `filters` predicate using AND.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| serves     | object | Optional    | Optional authoritative service-target predicate. When present, it combines with `distance` and every supplied `filters` predicate using AND.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Request Grammar

Each request input has a distinct role:

| Input                 | Meaning                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `query`               | Free-text retrieval (e.g., "restaurants near me that deliver").                                                        |
| `distance`            | A relation between a candidate Location and an explicit Platform-supplied center point and inclusive radius.           |
| `serves`              | A relation between a candidate Location and one explicit Platform-supplied service target.                             |
| `filters`             | Predicates over inherent or current Location facts: `hours`, `amenities`, and `items`, plus extension-defined filters. |
| `context` / `signals` | Provisional hints for relevance, localization, and bounded default selection; never spatial proof.                     |
| `pagination`          | A request for the shape of a bounded result page.                                                                      |

`distance` and `serves` sit at the request root because they compare a candidate Location against external facts the Platform supplies, while `filters` predicates ask whether the Location itself has or currently satisfies a fact. The two relations are independent: either can anchor a request by itself, they can use different points, and neither inherits an operand from the other.

For any candidate Location, every explicit structured constraint is conjunctive:

```text
matches = distance (when present)
      AND serves (when present)
      AND every supplied filters.* predicate
```

This rule defines observable results, not backend evaluation order.

A Business **MAY** use the `query` text to narrow and rank results as ordinary free-text retrieval, including letting spatial phrases in it (for example, "near me") influence text relevance and ranking. The `query` never carries structured authority in either direction. A Business **MUST NOT** treat `query` text as creating a `distance` or `serves` relation or a `filters` predicate. Only explicit constraints establish structured matching; spatial proof comes only from the operands in [Spatial Relations](#spatial-relations). A Business **MUST NOT** relax an explicit structured constraint because of the `query` text: a Location that fails `distance`, `serves`, or a `filters` predicate is excluded no matter how well it matches the query.

### Bounded Browse

A request without a spatial relation is valid. An empty body `{}`, a request carrying only `context` or `signals`, a request carrying only `pagination`, and a filters-only request are each a bounded browse over the Business's default, policy-controlled selection — never a spatial assertion and never an export. A request carrying only `filters.items` remains non-spatial: it constrains the candidate set through its explicit item identifiers without asserting any spatial relation. Page size follows the shared [Pagination](#pagination) contract.

A Business **MAY** use `context`, `signals`, and IP-derived locality to influence ranking, localization, or selection of a bounded default browse page. A Business using those hints **MUST NOT** treat that choice as proof that a Location serves a target or falls within an unstated radius; only explicit `distance` and `serves` operands establish spatial matching.

### Rejection and Empty Results

Requests that fail the Search request schema use the binding's invalid-request mechanism. The same mechanism carries the defined semantic errors for `distance`, `serves`, and unsupported filters; see [Spatial Relations](#spatial-relations) and [Search Filters](#search-filters). A well-formed relation or supported predicate that simply matches no Locations remains a successful empty business outcome (see [Empty Search](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/#common-scenarios)).

## Spatial Relations

### Distance

The `distance` relation matches Locations within an inclusive radius of an explicit center point. Both members are required: `distance.center` is a `geo.json` point in World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) decimal degrees, and `distance.max` is the inclusive maximum distance in meters.

| Name   | Type                                               | Requirement  | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| center | [Geo](/pr-test/draft/specification/reference/#geo) | **Required** | Explicit center of the radius. The Platform MUST supply it; the Business MUST NOT derive it from context, signals, an IP address, or `serves`.                                          |
| max    | number                                             | **Required** | Inclusive maximum distance in RFC 7035 distance unit (meters). A Business unable to honor the supplied value MUST reject the request rather than clamp it or substitute another radius. |

The Platform **MUST** supply `distance.center` whenever it supplies `distance`. The Business **MUST NOT** derive a missing center from `context`, `signals`, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, or `serves`; a request missing a required operand is invalid rather than broader than intended.

Matching semantics are closed:

- The computed distance is the shortest geodesic distance over the WGS 84 ellipsoid between `distance.center` and the Location's authoritative `geo`, in meters. When the two points lie on opposite sides of the 180-degree meridian the same rule applies — the shortest geodesic — with no special casing.
- The Business **MUST** compare the unrounded computed value to `distance.max`; a Location matches when that value is less than or equal to `distance.max`, and exact equality matches.
- The Business **MUST NOT** apply a tolerance band, substitute an operand, clamp the radius, or evaluate route, travel, or planar distance in place of the geodesic comparison.
- The Business **MAY** compute the value with any algorithm that produces the WGS 84 inverse-geodesic result at sufficient precision that the match outcome agrees with the unrounded comparison defined above.
- A Business that cannot honor a supplied `distance.max` (for example, a radius cap below the requested value) **MUST** reject the request with an actionable error; it **MUST NOT** silently clamp the radius or substitute its own. The permission to return fewer results under [Pagination](#pagination) never permits reducing `distance.max`.
- A Location without a usable authoritative `geo` does not match; exclusion is a non-match, not an error.

The relation is a hard restriction; it neither requests nor implies distance ordering. Ranking remains separate Business behavior unless another negotiated input specifies it.

### Serves

The `serves` relation matches Locations that can provisionally serve one explicit target. It is a one-entry map: the Platform **MUST** supply exactly one target representation — `point`, `address`, or a negotiated reverse-domain extension target.

| Name    | Type                                               | Requirement | Description                               |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| point   | [Geo](/pr-test/draft/specification/reference/#geo) | Optional    | WGS 84 coordinates of the service target. |
| address | any                                                | Optional    | Coarse locality of the service target.    |

- `point` is a WGS 84 latitude and longitude coordinate pair and uses the same coordinate representation as `distance.center`.
- `address` is a coarse locality. When supplying it, the Platform **MUST** include at least one non-empty `address_country`, `address_region`, or `postal_code`. An `address` is invalid if it is empty, contains only unrecognized fields, or all of its recognized fields are empty. A `serves` map is invalid if it is empty or contains more than one target.

The explicit target is authoritative. Omitting `serves` never creates an implicit serviceability check, and the Business **MUST NOT** derive a target from `context`, `signals`, or an IP address.

A Location matches when at least one currently available service or fulfillment method at that Location can provisionally serve the target. The match does not disclose the Business's coverage geometry, identify the qualifying method, reserve capacity, or guarantee that checkout or fulfillment will succeed; the Business revalidates serviceability against binding transaction data later in the commerce flow.

A Business unable to evaluate an otherwise well-formed target — for example, a postal code system it does not model — **MUST** return an actionable request error; it **MUST NOT** fall back to a coarser interpretation or return broadened results. If a namespaced target's extension was not negotiated, the Business **MUST** return an actionable request error rather than silently omit the target.

The relation also has a deliberate correlation limit: a Location matching both `serves` and [`filters.items`](#item-availability-filter) satisfies each constraint independently. The match establishes that at least one method can provisionally serve the target and that the Business can currently provide every referenced item at that Location — not that the same method can fulfill those items to that target.

## Search Filters

Standard Location filters are `hours`, `amenities`, and `items`. A Business **MAY** support additional custom filters through `additionalProperties`. All supplied filters combine with AND. A Business that receives a filter it does not support **MUST** reject the request with an actionable error; it **MUST NOT** ignore the filter and return broadened results.

| amenities | Array\[[Amenity Type](/pr-test/draft/specification/reference/#amenity-type)\] | Optional    | Filter by amenity identifier.

| items     | Array[string]                                                                 | Optional    | Current item-availability filter. A candidate Location matches only when the Business can currently provide every referenced item at that Location; all references combine with AND.                   |

### Hours-Based Filter

The standard `filters.hours` object requires `open_at`, an RFC 3339 instant expressed with `Z` or a numeric offset.

A Platform selects `open_at` to represent the time relevant to the Buyer's intent. It can use its current time or choose another time, such as an expected arrival, pickup, or order-acceptance time. A Platform **MAY** round or adjust its selected time to the granularity appropriate to the interaction, but the value it sends identifies one specific instant.

For each candidate Location, a Business **MUST** evaluate `open_at` exactly as supplied. It converts the instant to the local date, day of week, and time using the Location's authoritative `timezone`, then evaluates the effective schedule under [Operating Hours](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/#operating-hours). The `Z` or numeric offset in `open_at` identifies the instant; it does not identify the Location's timezone.

A Business **MUST** return a Location only when it can establish that the Location is open at `open_at`. If its schedule data is absent, invalid, outside the range for which it can evaluate authoritatively, or otherwise unusable, the Location does not match the filter. A Business **MUST NOT** round, shift, or otherwise reinterpret the supplied instant.

### Amenity Filter

The `amenities` filter identifies static features, services, or capabilities. A Location matches only when its response `amenities` map contains every supplied identifier as an exact key. See [Amenity Vocabulary](#amenity-vocabulary) for well-known values.

#### Amenity Vocabulary

UCP defines an open reverse-DNS vocabulary for amenity identifiers. A Business **SHOULD** use a well-known UCP identifier when its definition accurately describes the amenity and **MAY** define additional identifiers under a namespace it controls. The following table is a non-exhaustive list of well-known values:

| Amenity Name                               | Domain             | Semantic Definition                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev.ucp.amenity.wi_fi`                    | Common / Universal | Complimentary or Buyer-accessible wireless internet on premises.       |
| `dev.ucp.amenity.parking`                  | Common / Universal | Dedicated parking lot or garage available on site.                     |
| `dev.ucp.amenity.shopping.curbside_pickup` | Retail Shopping    | Dedicated vehicle bays for order pickup without entering the building. |
| `dev.ucp.amenity.shopping.in_store_pickup` | Retail Shopping    | Dedicated counter or area inside store for order pickup.               |

Location responses use the shared [Amenity representation](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/#amenity), which keeps custom identifiers presentable without assigning them standardized semantics.

A Platform supplies amenity filters as an array of identifiers. Matching uses exact whole-key equality; namespace prefixes carry no wildcard or inheritance semantics. A Business **MUST NOT** ignore a supplied identifier: a Location whose authoritative amenity set lacks any supplied key does not match. This includes identifiers the Business does not use; no diagnostic is required for an ordinary non-match. When `filters.amenities` is present, the Business **MUST** include every supplied identifier in each returned Location's `amenities` map. A Platform **MUST** reject a returned Location as non-conforming if it omits the map or any requested key, rather than accept a broadened or unverifiable result.

### Item Availability Filter

The standard `filters.items` value is a nonempty array of distinct item identifiers. Each identifier is a stable, opaque, Business-scoped reference to an orderable item in the applicable domain, such as a shopping variant or a food menu item. The filter asks one coarse discovery question: at which Locations can the Business currently provide every referenced item?

A Location matches only when the Business can currently provide every referenced item at that Location. The Business evaluates each identifier independently against its current data when processing the request, and the per-item outcomes combine with AND. Evaluation is independent of the Location's operating hours and of any fulfillment method: `filters.hours` is a separate conjunctive predicate, and `filters.hours.open_at` does not change the availability evaluation instant, even when it represents a future arrival or pickup time.

An identifier that is unknown, is currently unavailable, or cannot be evaluated at a candidate Location fails the filter for that Location. The Business **MUST NOT** ignore such an identifier to return broadened results; the candidate does not match. This is an ordinary non-match and requires no diagnostic (see [Empty Search](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/#common-scenarios)).

A match is a coarse, provisional assertion, and the response intentionally remains Location-shaped without echoing per-item facts. The result does not evaluate Platform-selected quantities, prove that the referenced items can be transacted together as one basket, select or identify a fulfillment method, reserve any item, or predict availability at a future instant. The Business **MUST** revalidate transaction-specific availability, quantities, methods, and terms later in the commerce flow. See [Relationship to Other Capabilities](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/#relationship-to-other-capabilities).

Combining `filters.items` with a pickup amenity (for example, `dev.ucp.amenity.shopping.in_store_pickup`) matches Locations where every referenced item is currently available and pickup is generally supported. The two predicates remain independent: the combination does not establish that the referenced items are available through pickup. Exact one-shot, method-qualified store finding is outside the base Location capability and requires an applicable domain capability that can correlate item availability with a fulfillment method.

## Pagination

Cursor-based pagination for list operations. Cursors are opaque strings. A Business **MAY** encode them as stateless keyset tokens.

### Page Size

The `limit` parameter is a requested page size, not a guaranteed result count. When `limit` is omitted, the Business **MUST** apply a default page size. A default of 10 is **RECOMMENDED**, but the Business **MAY** choose another value.

The Business **MAY** return fewer results than the requested or default page size, including when enforcing its maximum page size. A Platform **MUST NOT** assume that the response count equals either value. This permission applies only to page size; it does not permit reducing `distance.max` (see [Distance](#distance)).

### Pagination Request

  }
}
```

```json

}
```

The explicit `serves.point` is the authoritative service target; the coarse `context` hints only shape ranking and localization. At the supplied instant, it is Monday at `10:00` in `America/Los_Angeles`, within the returned interval. See [Operating Hours](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/#operating-hours) for complete schedule evaluation rules. The custom amenity remains presentable through its description without assigning the identifier any standardized UCP meaning.

### Locations where every requested item is available within a distance

```json
{
  "distance": {
    "center": {
      "latitude": 40.707,
      "longitude": -74.011
    },
    "max": 10000
  },
  "filters": {
    "items": [
      "item_id_phone_15_pro",
      "item_id_phone_15_pro_case_black"
    ]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "ucp": {
    "version": "draft",
    "capabilities": {
      "dev.ucp.common.location.search": [
        {"version": "draft"}
      ]
    }
  },
  "locations": [
    {
      "id": "loc_downtown_electronics",
      "name": "Downtown Electronics",
      "address": {
        "street_address": "100 Broadway",
        "address_locality": "New York",
        "address_region": "NY",
        "address_country": "US",
        "postal_code": "10005"
      },
      "amenities": {
        "dev.ucp.amenity.shopping.curbside_pickup": {
          "description": "Curbside pickup"
        },
        "dev.ucp.amenity.shopping.in_store_pickup": {
          "description": "In-store pickup"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each returned Location satisfies the `distance` relation and the `items` availability predicate for every supplied identifier. The response does not echo per-item facts. The `distance` relation does not require the Business to disclose the Location coordinate used in the evaluation.
