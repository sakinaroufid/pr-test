# Location Lookup Capability

- **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.common.location.lookup`

Resolves identifiers to physical Locations. Supports full-detail batch retrieval of multiple Locations or retrieval of a single Location (useful for a dedicated Location detail page), optionally refined by the same explicit spatial relations and filters as Search (see [Refinement](#refinement)).

## Operation

| Operation              | Description                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lookup Location(s)** | Retrieve single or multiple Locations by identifier. |

## Supported Identifiers

The `ids` parameter accepts an array of identifiers. A Business **MUST** support lookup by a Location's stable canonical `Location.id` and **MAY** additionally support secondary or alias identifiers.

A Business **MUST** dedupe duplicate identifiers in the request. When an identifier matches multiple Locations, the Business returns the matching Locations and **MAY** limit the result set. When multiple identifiers resolve to the same Location, the Business **MUST** return it only once.

### Platform Correlation

The response does not guarantee order. Each Location carries an `inputs` array identifying which requested identifiers resolved to it. Every entry contains a required `id`, copied exactly from the Lookup request.

Multiple request identifiers may resolve to the same Location. When this occurs, the Location's `inputs` array contains one entry per resolved identifier. A Business **MUST NOT** include a Location without an `inputs` entry in a Lookup response.

### Batch Size

A Business **SHOULD** accept at least 10 identifiers per request and **MAY** enforce a maximum batch size. The maximum applies after duplicate identifiers are deduplicated.

When a request exceeds that maximum, the Business **MUST** process the first maximum number of distinct identifiers in request order and return a successful response for that prefix. It **MUST** include an informational message with `code: "batch_limit_applied"`; the message content **MUST** state the applied maximum and how many identifiers were not processed. The Business **MUST NOT** evaluate the omitted suffix or report its identifiers as unresolved. A Platform **MUST NOT** interpret the omitted suffix as unresolved and **MAY** submit it in a subsequent request.

### Refinement

The Business first resolves the identifiers and deduplicates repeated values. Optional root `distance` and `serves` relations and `filters` predicates then refine the resolved set. All supplied criteria combine with AND: a resolved Location is returned only when it satisfies every supplied relation and filter. The relations and predicates use the same schemas and semantics as Search — see [Spatial Relations](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/search/#spatial-relations), [Search Filters](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/search/#search-filters), and [Item Availability Filter](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/search/#item-availability-filter).

For example, if a Platform requests `["loc_downtown", "loc_uptown"]` with an hours filter of `{"open_at": "2026-05-18T17:00:00Z"}`:

1. The Business first resolves both identifiers to their respective Locations.
1. The Business evaluates the supplied instant against each resolved Location.
1. If `loc_uptown` is closed at that instant, the Business excludes it and returns only `loc_downtown`.

An identifier that does not resolve has no corresponding returned Location or `inputs` entry. If an identifier resolves to a Location that fails any supplied criterion, including because a `filters.items` identifier is unknown, is unavailable, or cannot be evaluated there, that Location and its corresponding `inputs` entry are omitted. The request still succeeds. The Business **MAY** attach an informational `not_found` message for an unresolved Location identifier, but no per-identifier explanation is guaranteed for a refinement non-match.

### Request

Request body for batch location lookup. The Business resolves and deduplicates `ids` before applying `distance`, `serves`, and every supplied `filters` predicate; all structured predicates combine with AND.

| filters  | object        | Optional     | Filter criteria to narrow Location Search and Lookup results. All supplied filters combine with AND.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| context  | object        | Optional     | Provisional buyer signals for relevance and localization—not authoritative data. Businesses SHOULD use these values when verified inputs (e.g., shipping address) are absent, and MAY ignore or down-rank them if inconsistent with higher-confidence signals (authenticated account, risk detection) or regulatory constraints (export controls). Eligibility and policy enforcement MUST occur at checkout time using binding transaction data. Context SHOULD be non-identifying and can be disclosed progressively—coarse signals early, finer resolution as the session progresses. Higher-resolution data (shipping address, billing address) supersedes context. |
| signals  | object        | Optional     | Environment data provided by the platform to support authorization and abuse prevention. Values MUST NOT be buyer-asserted claims — platforms provide signals based on direct observation or independently verifiable third-party attestations. All signal keys MUST use reverse-domain naming to ensure provenance and prevent collisions when multiple extensions contribute to the shared namespace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| ucp       | any             | **Required** | UCP metadata for location responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Examples

The following request and response are transport-neutral UCP payloads.

### Downtown Store schedule

```json
{
  "ids": ["loc_downtown", "downtown-store"]
}
```

```json
{
  "ucp": {
    "version": "draft",
    "capabilities": {
      "dev.ucp.common.location.lookup": [
        {"version": "draft"}
      ]
    }
  },
  "locations": [
    {
      "id": "loc_downtown",
      "inputs": [
        {"id": "loc_downtown"},
        {"id": "downtown-store"}
      ],
      "name": "Downtown Store",
      "address": {
        "street_address": "100 Broadway",
        "address_locality": "New York",
        "address_region": "NY",
        "address_country": "US",
        "postal_code": "10005"
      },
      "geo": {
        "latitude": 40.707,
        "longitude": -74.011
      },
      "amenities": {
        "dev.ucp.amenity.shopping.curbside_pickup": {
          "description": "Curbside pickup"
        },
        "dev.ucp.amenity.shopping.in_store_pickup": {
          "description": "In-store pickup"
        },
        "dev.ucp.amenity.parking": {
          "description": "On-site parking"
        }
      },
      "timezone": "America/New_York",
      "hours": [
        {"day": "monday", "opens": "09:00", "closes": "21:00"},
        {"day": "tuesday", "opens": "09:00", "closes": "12:00"},
        {"day": "tuesday", "opens": "13:00", "closes": "21:00"},
        {"day": "wednesday", "opens": "09:00", "closes": "21:00"},
        {"day": "thursday", "opens": "09:00", "closes": "21:00"},
        {"day": "friday", "opens": "09:00", "closes": "22:00"},
        {"day": "saturday", "opens": "10:00", "closes": "20:00"}
      ],
      "exception_hours": [
        {
          "title": "Thanksgiving",
          "valid_from": "2026-11-26",
          "valid_through": "2026-11-26"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The response correlates the canonical identifier and the Business-supported alias to one Location. Tuesday's two `hours` entries form a split shift. Sunday has no `hours` entry, meaning no regular interval begins that day. The `exception_hours` entry omits `opens` and `closes`, making it a full closure. See [Operating Hours](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/#operating-hours) for schedule representation and evaluation rules.

### Item availability refinement

```json
{
  "ids": ["loc_downtown", "loc_uptown"],
  "filters": {
    "items": ["item_id_phone_15_pro"]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "ucp": {
    "version": "draft",
    "capabilities": {
      "dev.ucp.common.location.lookup": [
        {"version": "draft"}
      ]
    }
  },
  "locations": [
    {
      "id": "loc_downtown",
      "inputs": [
        {"id": "loc_downtown"}
      ],
      "name": "Downtown Store"
    }
  ]
}
```

Both identifiers resolve, but the Business cannot currently provide the referenced item at `loc_uptown`, so that Location and its `inputs` entry are omitted. The request still succeeds, and this ordinary refinement non-match requires no message (see [Item Availability Filter](https://sakinaroufid.github.io/pr-test/draft/specification/common/location/search/#item-availability-filter)).

### Partial success

```json
{
  "ids": ["loc_downtown", "loc_invalid_id"]
}
```

```json
{
  "ucp": {
    "version": "draft",
    "capabilities": {
      "dev.ucp.common.location.lookup": [
        {"version": "draft"}
      ]
    }
  },
  "locations": [
    {
      "id": "loc_downtown",
      "inputs": [
        {"id": "loc_downtown"}
      ],
      "name": "Downtown Store"
    }
  ],
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "info",
      "code": "not_found",
      "content": "Unable to find the location associated with loc_invalid_id."
    }
  ]
}
```

The request succeeds with the Locations that resolve. A Business can use an informational `not_found` message to identify an unresolved identifier.

### Batch limit applied

The following Business accepts at most two distinct identifiers per Lookup request.

```json
{
  "ids": ["loc_downtown", "loc_uptown", "loc_airport"]
}
```

```json
{
  "ucp": {
    "version": "draft",
    "capabilities": {
      "dev.ucp.common.location.lookup": [
        {"version": "draft"}
      ]
    }
  },
  "locations": [
    {
      "id": "loc_downtown",
      "inputs": [{"id": "loc_downtown"}],
      "name": "Downtown Store"
    },
    {
      "id": "loc_uptown",
      "inputs": [{"id": "loc_uptown"}],
      "name": "Uptown Store"
    }
  ],
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "info",
      "code": "batch_limit_applied",
      "content": "Processed the first 2 of 3 distinct identifiers; 1 identifier was not processed."
    }
  ]
}
```

The Business evaluates `loc_downtown` and `loc_uptown` in request order. `loc_airport` was not evaluated and is not unresolved; the Platform can submit it in a subsequent request.
