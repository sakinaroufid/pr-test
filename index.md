UCP is expanding beyond retail: Lodging draft specification now available. **Food coming soon.**

# Universal Commerce Protocol

The common language for platforms, agents, and businesses.

UCP provides building blocks for agentic commerce across industries—from discovery to checkout and beyond—allowing the ecosystem to operate through one standard, without custom builds.

## Built for flexibility, security, and scale

Agentic commerce requires interoperability. UCP is built on industry standards — REST and JSON-RPC transports; [Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)](https://ap2-protocol.org/), [Agent2Agent (A2A)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/), and [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) support built-in — so different systems can work together without custom integration.

### Scalable and universal

Surface-agnostic design that scales to support any business (from small to enterprise), in every industry, across all modalities, including chat, visual commerce, and voice.

### Businesses at the center

Built to facilitate commerce, ensuring businesses retain control and remain the Merchant of Record, with full ownership of customer relationships.

### Open and extensible

Open and extensible by design, enabling development of community-driven capabilities and extensions across industries.

### Secure and private

Built on proven security standards for account linking (OAuth 2.0) and secure payment (AP2) via payment mandates and verifiable credentials.

### Frictionless payments

Open wallet ecosystem with interoperability between providers, ensuring buyers can use their preferred payment methods.

## See it in action

UCP is designed to facilitate the entire commerce lifecycle, from discovery and search to final sale and post-purchase support. The protocol supports a range of core capabilities, including: Catalog Search and Lookup, Cart Building, Identity Linking, Checkout, and Order Management.
