# Cart Capability

* **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.shopping.cart`

## Overview

The Cart capability enables basket building without the complexity of checkout.
While [Checkout](../checkout/index.md) manages payment handlers, status lifecycle, and
order finalization, cart provides a lightweight CRUD interface for item
collection before purchase intent is established.

**When to use Cart vs Checkout:**

* **Cart**: User is exploring, comparing, saving items for later. No payment
  configuration needed. Platform/agent can freely add, remove, update items.
* **Checkout**: User has expressed purchase intent. Payment handlers are
  configured, status lifecycle begins, session moves toward completion.

The typical flow: `cart session` &#8594; `checkout session` &#8594; `order`

Carts support:

* **Incremental building**: Add/remove items across sessions
* **Localized estimates**: Context-aware pricing without full checkout overhead
* **Sharing**: `continue_url` enables cart sharing and recovery

## Cart vs Checkout

| Aspect | Cart | Checkout |
| ------ | ---- | -------- |
| **Purpose** | Pre-purchase exploration | Purchase finalization |
| **Payment** | None | Required (handlers, instruments) |
| **Status** | Binary (exists/not found) | Lifecycle (`incomplete` → `completed`) |
| **Complete Operation** | No | Yes |
| **Totals** | Estimates (may be partial) | Final pricing |

## Cart-to-Checkout Conversion

When the cart capability is negotiated, platforms can convert a cart to checkout
by providing `cart_id` in the Create Checkout request. The cart contents
(`line_items`, `context`, `buyer`) initialize the checkout session.

<!-- ucp:example schema=shopping/cart def=checkout op=create direction=request -->
```json
{
  "cart_id": "cart_abc123",
  "line_items": []
}
```

Because the cart checkout extension composes onto the base Checkout schema,
`line_items` remains a required request field; the platform MUST include line_items and SHOULD set it to an empty array (`"line_items": []`).
array (`"line_items": []`). The business MUST use the cart contents and MUST
ignore overlapping fields in the checkout payload. The `cart_id` parameter is
only available when the cart capability is advertised in the business profile.

**Idempotent conversion:**

If an incomplete checkout already exists for the given `cart_id`, the business
MUST return the existing checkout session rather than creating a new one. This
ensures a single active checkout per cart and prevents conflicting sessions.

**Cart lifecycle after conversion:**

When checkout is initialized via `cart_id`, the cart and checkout sessions
SHOULD be linked for the duration of the checkout.

* **During active checkout** — Business SHOULD maintain the cart and reflect
    relevant checkout modifications (quantity changes, item removals) back to
    the cart. This supports back-to-storefront flows when buyers transition
    between checkout and storefront.

* **After checkout completion** — Business MAY clear the cart based on TTL,
    completion of the checkout, or other business logic. Subsequent operations
    on a cleared cart ID return `not_found`; the platform can start a new
    session with `create_cart`.

## Quantity and sale basis

Cart line items apply the shared
[quantities and units](../../overview/index.md#quantities-and-units) contract. Each
`line_items[].quantity` is an integer step count in the item's authoritative
sale basis. On a Business response, an absent
`line_items[].item.quantity_unit` encodes the default `each` basis, so
`quantity` counts whole items.

On a Platform request, omission of `line_items[].item.quantity_unit` makes no
assertion. The Business interprets `quantity` using the item's authoritative
sale basis, so a request for a measure-denominated item can omit the descriptor
without asserting `each`. The Platform **MAY** include `item.quantity_unit` to
assert the sale-basis identity.

Cart follows [Checkout — Quantity and sale basis](../checkout/index.md#quantity-and-sale-basis)
for sale-basis discovery, assertion matching, mismatch conversion or
rejection, response echo, ordering-increment handling, and line pricing.
Cart totals remain estimates (see [Total](#total)). A measure-denominated line
counts as one line item in cart summaries; its `quantity` is an amount, not an
item count.

## Actions

The cart surfaces outstanding Action instances in its response-only `actions`
map, defined in [Overview — Actions](../../overview/index.md#actions).

The cart has no status lifecycle. Each Action gates only the cart effect
specified for its Action type. The Business **MUST NOT** treat an outstanding
Action as a reason to reject an unrelated cart operation. The Platform **MAY**
continue to add, remove, and update items while an Action is outstanding.

After processing an Action, the Platform **SHOULD** use [Get Cart](#get-cart)
or a subsequent update response to obtain the latest Cart.

## Scopes

The Cart capability defines the following well-known scopes for
user-authenticated access:

| Scope | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.cart:manage` | All cart operations on behalf of the authenticated user — create, read, update, persist. |

Scope declaration, derivation, and rules for extending this set with
custom scopes are defined in [Identity Linking — Scopes](../../common/identity-linking/index.md#scopes).

## Guidelines

### Platform

* **MAY** use carts for pre-purchase exploration and session persistence.
* **SHOULD** convert cart to checkout when user expresses purchase intent.
* **MAY** display `continue_url` for handoff to business UI.
* **SHOULD** handle `not_found` gracefully when cart expires or is canceled.

### Business

* **SHOULD** provide `continue_url` for cart handoff and session recovery.
* TODO: discuss `continue_url` destination - cart vs checkout.
* **SHOULD** provide estimated totals when calculable.
* **MAY** omit fulfillment totals until checkout when address is unknown.
* **SHOULD** return informational messages for validation warnings.
* **MAY** set cart expiry via `expires_at`.
* **SHOULD** follow [cart lifecycle requirements](#cart-to-checkout-conversion)
    when checkout is initialized via `cart_id`.

## Cart Schema Definition

{{ schema_fields('cart_resp', 'shopping/cart') }}

## Operations

The Cart capability defines the following logical operations.

| Operation | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Create Cart** | Creates a new cart session. |
| **Get Cart** | Retrieves the current state of a cart session. |
| **Update Cart** | Updates a cart session. |
| **Cancel Cart** | Cancels a cart session. |

### Create Cart

Creates a new cart session with line items and optional buyer/context
information for localized pricing estimates.

When **all** requested items are unavailable, the business MAY return an
error response instead of creating a cart resource. `ucp.status` is the
primary discriminator; the absence of `id` is a consistent secondary
indicator:

<!-- ucp:example schema=common/types/error_response op=read -->
```json
{
  "ucp": { "version": "{{ ucp_version }}", "status": "error" },
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "out_of_stock",
      "content": "All requested items are currently out of stock",
      "severity": "unrecoverable"
    }
  ],
  "continue_url": "https://merchant.com/"
}
```

* [REST Binding](rest.md#create-cart)
* [MCP Binding](mcp.md#create_cart)

### Get Cart

Retrieves the latest state of a cart session. Returns `not_found` if the cart
does not exist, has expired, or was canceled.

* [REST Binding](rest.md#get-cart)
* [MCP Binding](mcp.md#get_cart)

### Update Cart

Performs a full replacement of the cart session. The platform **MUST** send
the entire cart resource. The provided resource replaces the existing cart
state on the business side.

* [REST Binding](rest.md#update-cart)
* [MCP Binding](mcp.md#update_cart)

### Cancel Cart

Cancels a cart session. Business MUST return the cart state before deletion.
Subsequent operations for this cart ID SHOULD return `not_found`.

* [REST Binding](rest.md#cancel-cart)
* [MCP Binding](mcp.md#cancel_cart)

## Entities

Cart reuses the same entity schemas as [Checkout](../checkout/index.md). This ensures
consistent data structures when converting a cart to a checkout session.

Taxes MAY be included where calculable. Platforms SHOULD assume cart totals
